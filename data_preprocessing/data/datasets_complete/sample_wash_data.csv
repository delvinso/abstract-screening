#6046,The role of older children and adults in wild poliovirus transmission,"Blake, Isobel M.; Martin, Rebecca; Goel, Ajay; Khetsuriani, Nino; Everts, Johannes; Wolff, Christopher; Wassilak, Steven; Aylward, R. Bruce; Grassly, Nicholas C.","As polio eradication inches closer, the absence of poliovirus circulation in most of the world and imperfect vaccination coverage are resulting in immunity gaps and polio outbreaks affecting adults. Furthermore, imperfect, waning intestinal immunity among older children and adults permits reinfection and poliovirus shedding, prompting calls to extend the age range of vaccination campaigns even in the absence of cases in these age groups. The success of such a strategy depends on the contribution to poliovirus transmission by older ages, which has not previously been estimated. We fit a mathematical model of poliovirus transmission to time series data from two large outbreaks that affected adults (Tajikistan 2010, Republic of Congo 2010) using maximum-likelihood estimation based on iterated particle-filtering methods. In Tajikistan, the contribution of unvaccinated older children and adults to transmission was minimal despite a significant number of cases in these age groups [reproduction number, R = 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.52) for >5-y-olds compared to 2.18 (2.06-2.45) for 0- to 5-y-olds]. In contrast, in the Republic of Congo, the contribution of older children and adults was significant [R = 1.85 (1.83-4.00)], perhaps reflecting sanitary and socioeconomic variables favoring efficient virus transmission. In neither setting was there evidence for a significant role of imperfect intestinal immunity in the transmission of poliovirus. Bringing the immunization response to the Tajikistan outbreak forward by 2 wk would have prevented an additional 130 cases (21%), highlighting the importance of early outbreak detection and response.",2014,NA,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,111,29,10604-9,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1323688111,10763,Blake 2014,NA,NA,0,0
#1683,Calves as a source of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among young children in an agricultural closed community,"Miron, D.; Kenes, J.; Dagan, R.","Transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans, originating mainly in calves, had been suggested previously but has remained unproved. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis that started among calves was transmitted to multiple pediatric groups living in close contact through one family who had close contact with the calves. Eleven of 19 (58%) infants and young children ages 10 to 15 months had Cryptosporidium compared with 3 of 27 (11%) of those ages 36 to 60 months and none of those ages 16 to 35 months. None of the asymptomatic children was positive for Cryptosporidium. These data emphasize that an extensive human to human transmission does not rule out the zoonotic nature of cryptosporidiosis.",1991,NA,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,10,6,438-41,NA,NA,13128,Miron 1991,NA,NA,1,0
#5565,A decrease in the number of cases of necrotizing enterocolitis associated with the enhancement of infection prevention and control measures during a Staphylococcus aureus outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Lemyre, Brigitte; Xiu, Wenlong; Bouali, Nicole Rouvinez; Brintnell, Janet; Janigan, Jo-Anne; Suh, Kathryn N.; Barrowman, Nicholas","OBJECTIVE: Most cases of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are sporadic, but outbreaks in hospital settings suggest an infectious cause. Our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experienced an outbreak of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). We aimed to assess whether the enhancement of infection prevention and control measures would be associated with a reduction in the number of cases of NEC., DESIGN: Retrospective chart review., SETTING: A 24-bed, university-affiliated, inborn level 3 NICU., PARTICIPANTS: Infants of less than 30 weeks gestation or birth weight <= 1,500 g admitted to the NICU between January 2007 and December 2008 were considered at risk of NEC. All cases of NEC were reviewed., INTERVENTIONS: Infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene education, were enhanced during the outbreak. Avoidance of overcapacity in the NICU was reinforced, environmental services (ES) measures were enhanced, and ES hours were increased., RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-two at-risk infants were admitted during the study. Their gestational age and birth weight (mean +/- SD) were 28.2 +/- 2.7 weeks and 1,031 +/- 290 g, respectively. The proportion of NEC was 18/110 (16.4%) before the outbreak, 1/54 (1.8%) during the outbreak, and 4/118 (3.4%) after the outbreak. After adjustment for gestational age, birth weight, gender, and singleton versus multiple births, the proportion was lower in the postoutbreak period than in the preoutbreak period (P < .002)., CONCLUSION: Although this observational study cannot establish a causal relationship, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of NEC following implementation of enhanced infection prevention and control measures to manage an MSSA outbreak.",2012,NA,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,33,1,29-33,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/663343,12717,Lemyre 2012,NA,Duplicate,0,0

#6443,Risk factors for gastroenteritis in child day care,"Enserink, R.; Mughini-Gras, L.; Duizer, E.; Kortbeek, T.; Van Pelt, W.","The child day-care centre (DCC) is often considered as one risk factor for gastroenteritis (GE) rather than a complex setting in which the interplay of many factors may influence the epidemiology of GE. This study aimed to identify DCC-level risk factors for GE and major enteropathogen occurrence. A dynamic network of 100 and 43 DCCs participated in a syndromic and microbiological surveillance during 2010-2013. The weekly incidence of GE events and weekly prevalence of five major enteropathogens (rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum) were modelled per DCC using mixed-effects negative binomial/Poisson regression models. Sixteen hundred children were surveyed up to 3 years, during which 1829 GE episodes were reported and 5197 faecal samples were analysed. Identified risk factors were: large DCC capacity, crowding, having animals, nappy changing areas, sandpits, paddling pools, cleaning potties in normal sinks, cleaning vomit with paper towels (but without cleaner), mixing of staff between child groups, and staff members with multiple daily duties. Protective factors were: disinfecting fomites with chlorine, cleaning vomit with paper towels (and cleaner), daily cleaning of bed linen/toys, cohorting and exclusion policies for ill children and staff. Targeting these factors may reduce the burden of DCC-related GE.",2015,NA,Epidemiology and infection,143,13,2707-20,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268814003367,11569,Enserink 2015,NA,NA,1,0
#5079,"Tracking progress toward global polio eradication --- worldwide, 2009--2010",NA,"Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988, progress has been tracked by 1) surveillance comprised of detection and investigation of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), coupled with environmental surveillance (sewage testing) in selected areas, and 2) timely testing of fecal specimens in accredited laboratories to identify polioviruses. The sensitivity of AFP case detection and the timeliness of AFP investigations are monitored with performance indicators. Polioviruses are isolated and characterized by the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN). This report assesses the quality of polio surveillance and the timeliness of poliovirus isolation reporting and characterization worldwide during 2009--2010. During that period, 77% of countries affected by wild poliovirus (WPV) met national performance standards for AFP surveillance; underperforming subnational areas were identified in two of four countries with reestablished WPV transmission and in 13 of 22 countries with WPV outbreaks. Targets for timely GPLN reporting of poliovirus isolation results were met in five World Health Organization (WHO) regions in 2009 and in four of six regions in 2010; targets for timely poliovirus characterization were met in four WHO regions in 2009 and in five regions in 2010. Monitoring of surveillance performance indicators at subnational levels continues to be critical to identifying surveillance gaps that might allow WPV circulation to be missed in certain areas or subpopulations. To achieve polio eradication, efforts are needed to further strengthen AFP surveillance, implement targeted environmental surveillance, and ensure that GPLN quality is maintained.",2011,NA,MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report,60,14,441-445,104872746.

R.; Ramirez, V.; Arguello, D. F.; Tomashek, K. M.; Dayan, G.","Dengue is endemic in Puerto Rico with the most recent outbreak occurring in 2007. Vector control has shown limited impact. Dengue vaccines may be effective for disease control. Knowledge of dengue prevention and the acceptability to participate in a Phase III dengue efficacy trial in Puerto Rico was assessed. Two structured questionnaires with open-ended questions were developed; 1) key informant interview questionnaire for university researchers, mayors, school principals/teachers, community leaders, and parents; 2) focus group questionnaire for children and parents. Sixty-four interviews with key informants and 45 focus groups with 96 parents and 111children were conducted in 12 municipalities with the highest dengue rates. Most participants knew about dengue prevention and perceived children as the most affected population; all felt at risk for dengue. Participants knew that vaccines prevent illness and indicated that a dengue vaccine would be ""fabulous""; 99% of parents would not allow their child to take part in a clinical trial. Barriers to child participation included: lack of trust and information on vaccine development and trial procedures; fear of infection due to vaccination; side effects (SE) and sequelae; and lack of transportation. Lack of trust and fear was associated with news reports on Influenza A-H1N1vaccine SE. Motivators for participation were: altruism, information on vaccine development and trial procedures, gaining protection against dengue, and getting free medical care and stipends for transportation or participation. Researchers stated that community and captive populations were the best settings for a clinical trial. Face to face interventions may be the best strategy to motivate parents to allow their children to participate in a dengue vaccine trial. Therefore, the following information should be included: study purpose, procedures and duration; results of prior studies; vaccine development, risks of SE and sequelae; differences between Influenza A H1N1and dengue vaccines; benefits; safety regulations for subjects; and transportation.",2010,NA,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,83,5 SUPPL. 1,271,NA,NA,9264,Perez-Guerra 2010,NA,NA,0,0

#3669,Lessons from nosocomial viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks,"Fisher-Hoch, Susan P.","The outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola in 2004-2005 shows once again the devastating and rapid spread of viral haemorrhagic fevers in medical settings where hygiene practices are poorly applied or ignored. The legacy of years of war and poverty in Angola has resulted in very poor medical education and services. The initial high rate of infection among infants in Angola may have been related to poor hospital practices, possibly administration of vaccines. Though the outbreak in Angola was in a part of Africa not previously known to have filovirus infection, prior ecological modelling had predicted this location and many others. Prevention of future outbreaks will not be easy. The urgent need is dissemination of knowledge and the training, discipline and resources for good clinical practice. Educating the public to demand higher standards could be a powerful tool.

Previous results suggested a viral etiology for these winter epidemics. We investigated the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea and their molecular diversity. One hundred sixty-one patients with acute diarrhea and 45 healthy patients (controls) from the general population were given a standardized questionnaire between December 1998 and May 1999. Stool specimens were screened for group A and C rotaviruses, human caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenovirus types 40 and 41 by reverse transcription-PCR and/or enzyme immunoassay. Virologic analysis was positive for 63 cases (39%). Caliciviruses and group A rotaviruses were the most frequent (19 and 17% of cases, respectively). Two control stool specimens were found positive for group A rotavirus, and one was found positive for astrovirus. Molecular characterization of the strains disclosed a cocirculation of P[8],G1, P[8],G4, and P[4],G2 rotaviruses; type 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 astroviruses; and Sapporo-like and Norwalk-like human caliciviruses. These four types of viruses accounted for an attributable risk of acute diarrhea of 34.7% for the general population, under the assumption of a causal role of these viruses.",2002,NA,Journal of clinical microbiology,40,11,4266-72,NA,NA,11144,Chikhi-Brachet 2002,NA,NA,0,0

M.; Chemtob, C.","Background: Children are uniquely sensitive to toxic exposures in the environment. This sensitivity reflects children's disproportionately heavy exposures coupled with the biologic vulnerability that is a consequence of their passage through the complex transitions of early development. Methods and Results: To assess effects on children's health associated with the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) of September 11, 2001, research teams at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and other academic health centers in New York City launched a series of clinical and epidemiologic studies. Mount Sinai investigators undertook a prospective analysis of pregnancy outcomes in 182 women who were pregnant on September 11, 2001, and who had been either inside or within 0.5 miles of the WTC at the time of the attacks; they found a doubling in incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) among infants born to exposed mothers as compared to infants born to unexposed women in northern Manhattan. A Columbia research team examined pregnancy outcomes in 329 women who lived, worked or gave birth in lower Manhattan in the 9 months after September 11; they found that these women gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weight and shorter length than women living at greater distances from Ground Zero. NYU investigators documented increased numbers of new asthma cases and aggravations of preexisting asthma in children living in lower Manhattan. Mount Sinai mental health researchers documented a significant increase in mental health problems in children who directly witnessed the attacks and subsequent traumatic events; these problems were most severe in children with a past history of psychological trauma.

The clinical and laboratory manifestations of leptospirosis and dengue together with their outcomes are also described. METHODS: This was an observational study conducted from 26 July to 30 November 2005. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed by a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by a positive immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody capture ELISA test. Clinical features of patients with and without leptospirosis, respectively, and with and without dengue, respectively, were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients (age range 1 month to 12 years) admitted to our hospital for acute febrile illness with no obvious focus of infection were enrolled in the study. Of these, 30 had malaria, 11 had enteric fever and seven had mixed infections. Twenty-seven patients had leptospirosis. Three clinical features were significantly associated with leptospirosis: flood water contact, myalgia and conjunctival suffusion. Eighty-one children had dengue.

V.","Analyzing the data on 1812 patients with respiratory diseases, mainly pulmonary tuberculosis, urgently admitted to a tuberculosis hospital for the pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) syndrome during 5.5 years showed that there was no seasonal prevalence in the development of a complication. There was a steady-state regularity of the prevalent admission of patients to hospital from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and no hemorrhage in 39% of them on admission. Evidence was provided for the low diagnostic value of hemoptysis in assessing the prediction of the developed PH syndrome. In PH syndrome, the hospital mortality decreased by 2.6 times (from 20.0 to 7.7%) due to a wider use of the artificial hypotension method, endoscopic bronchial blockade, to the development and introduction of new modes of intraoperative protection and sanitation of the tracheobronchial tree, to the prevention of asphyxia, hemo-aspiration pneumonia, and its pathogenetically resultant acute progression of tuberculosis.",2000,NA,Klinicheskaia kharakteristika bol'nykh ekstrenno gospitalizirovannykh s legochnym krovotecheniem.,NA,4,28-32,NA,NA,12503,Kirgintsev 2000,NA,NA,0,0

#5294,Geo-additive modelling of malaria in Burundi,"Nkurunziza, H.; Gebhardt, A.; Pilz, J.","Background: Malaria is a major public health issue in Burundi in terms of both morbidity and mortality, with around 2.5 million clinical cases and more than 15,000 deaths each year. It is still the single main cause of mortality in pregnant women and children below five years of age. Because of the severe health and economic burden of malaria, there is still a growing need for methods that will help to understand the influencing factors. Several studies/researches have been done on the subject yielding different results as which factors are most responsible for the increase in malaria transmission. This paper considers the modelling of the dependence of malaria cases on spatial determinants and climatic covariates including rainfall, temperature and humidity in Burundi. Methods. The analysis carried out in this work exploits real monthly data collected in the area of Burundi over 12 years (1996-2007). Semi-parametric regression models are used. The spatial analysis is based on a geo-additive model using provinces as the geographic units of study. The spatial effect is split into structured (correlated) and unstructured (uncorrelated) components. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The effects of the continuous covariates are modelled by cubic p-splines with 20 equidistant knots and second order random walk penalty. For the spatially correlated effect, Markov random field prior is chosen. The spatially uncorrelated effects are assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian. The effects of climatic covariates and the effects of other spatial determinants are estimated simultaneously in a unified regression framework. Results: The results obtained from the proposed model suggest that although malaria incidence in a given month is strongly positively associated with the minimum temperature of the previous months, regional patterns of malaria that are related to factors other than climatic variables have been identified, without being able to explain them. Conclusions: In this paper, semiparametric models are used to model the effects of both climatic covariates and spatial effects on malaria distribution in Burundi. The results obtained from the proposed models suggest a strong positive association between malaria incidence in a given month and the minimum temperature of the previous month. From the spatial effects, important spatial patterns of malaria that are related to factors other than climatic variables are identified. Potential explanations (factors) could be related to socio-economic conditions, food shortage, limited access to health care service, precarious housing, promiscuity, poor hygienic conditions, limited access to drinking water, land use (rice paddies for example), displacement of the population (due to armed conflicts). © 2011 Nkurunziza et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011,NA,Malaria Journal,10,NA,234,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-234,9082,Nkurunziza 2011,NA,NA,1,0
#3434,Major factors affecting the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases,"Church, D. L.","Infectious diseases have an ever-increasing importance worldwide not only because of the remarkable emergence and re-emergence of pathogens, but also because globalization and population mobility have forced our realization that to have global health, we must address the ongoing morbidity and mortality of common infections in the developing world, including the HIV pandemic. Because pathogens do not recognize national boundaries, the rapidity with which individuals can circumnavigate the globe incubating infections makes infectious diseases an enormous challenge for governments and for the public and primary health care systems. The time for action is now, given the enormity and complexity of the infectious disease challenges facing us today and beyond.

#5671,Fatal outbreaks of jaundice in pregnancy and the epidemic history of hepatitis e,"Teo, C. G.","Space-time clustering of people who fall acutely ill with jaundice, then slip into coma and death, is an alarming phenomenon, more markedly so when the victims are mostly or exclusively pregnant. Documentation of the peculiar, fatal predisposition of pregnant women during outbreaks of jaundice identifies hepatitis E and enables construction of its epidemic history. Between the last decade of the 18th century and the early decades of the 20th century, hepatitis E-like outbreaks were reported mainly from Western Europe and several of its colonies. During the latter half of the 20th century, reports of these epidemics, including those that became serologically confirmed as hepatitis E, emanated from, first, the eastern and southern Mediterranean littoral and, thereafter, Southern and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the rest of Africa. The dispersal has been accompanied by a trend towards more frequent and larger-scale occurrences. Epidemic and endemic hepatitis E still beset people inhabiting Asia and Africa, especially pregnant women and their fetuses and infants. Their relief necessitates not only accelerated access to potable water and sanitation but also vaccination against hepatitis E. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2012.",2012,NA,Epidemiology and Infection,140,5,767-787,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268811002925,9926,Teo 2012,NA,NA,1,0
#2539,Epidemiological explanation of an outbreak of gastro-enteritis in Sweden in the absence of detailed microbiological information,"McCarthy, N.; de Jong, B.; Ziese, T.; Sjolund, R.; Hjalt, C. A.; Giesecke, J.","Waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks have often gone undetected or been incompletely defined in terms of source and extent. Methods which allow detection or clarification of such events are therefore useful. We describe the methods used to detect and investigate such an outbreak. In autumn 1996 high school absence rates and the rate of parents absent from work to care for sick children suggested a health problem in a Swedish town which had a history of unexplained outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease. A systematic sample of 300 households was surveyed by post. Respondents represented 10% of the total population of the town. Questions concerning symptoms and exposures were included. The same questionnaire was used in a nearby town as a control. Sixty four percent of respondents reported an acute gastrointestinal illness during a two month period. Diarrhoea (90%) and abdominal pain (88%) were the most frequent symptoms among the sick. Two percent of those sick sought medical care. Exposures associated with disease were being a member of a large household, young age, and consumption of water from the community water supply. Attack rate showed a dose response relationship with increasing frequency of water consumption. The peak incidence of gastrointestinal illness occurred shortly after raw water quality control data had shown a rise in indicator bacteria. Further analysis, dividing those infected into groups according to when they became ill and whether they were the first member of their household to fall ill, supported the hypothesis of primary cases being infected from the water supply with some secondary person to person spread.",1998,NA,European journal of epidemiology,14,7,711-8,NA,NA,13017,McCarthy 1998,NA,NA,1,0

#5851,The impact of massed versus spaced instruction on learning of procedural skills in pediatric resuscitation,"Khan, F. A.; Patocka, C.; Bhanji, F.; Bank, I.; Dubrovsky, A.; Brody, D.","Introduction: Survival from cardiac arrest has been linked to the quality of resuscitation care. Unfortunately, health care providers frequently underperform in these critical scenarios, with a well-documented deterioration in skills following an advanced life support course. Improving initial training and preventing decay in knowledge and skills are a priority in resuscitation education. The purpose of this study was to determine if a resuscitation course taught in a spaced format compared to the usual ""massed"" instruction results in improved procedural skills. Methods: We delivered a case-based pediatric resuscitation course to two cohorts of medical students: one in a spaced format (four 75-minute weekly sessions) and the other in a massed format (a single 5-hour session). Four weeks following course completion, blinded observers assessed each learner at various skills stations. Primary outcomes were performance on bag-valve-mask ventilation (BVMV), intraosseous (IO) insertion, and chest compressions using expert-developed checklists. Secondary outcomes included performance of ""key components"" of the above skills. Results: Forty-five of 48 students completed the study protocol (23 spaced and 22 massed). Students in the spaced cohort scored higher overall for BVMV (6.9 +/- 1.4 v. 5.8 +/- 1.9, p < 0.04), without significant differences in scores for IO insertion (3.9 +/- 1 v. 3.7 +/- 1.2, p = 0.575) and chest compressions (10.9 +/- 2.7 v. 10.1 +/- 2.4, p = 0.342). They were also more likely to administer oxygen during BVMV (OR 47.2, 95% CI 5.2- 423, p < 0.001), adhere to a target ventilation rate (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.1- 21.2, p < 0.03), use a stool when appropriate for chest compressions (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.2-59, p < 0.03), and landmark correctly for IO insertion (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.3-24.3, p < 0.02). The intervention group also had a significantly shorter mean time to IO insertion (30.2 +/- 34 seconds v. 62.1 +/- 30 seconds, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Infrequent yet critically important procedures learned in a spaced format may result in better skill retention and more efficient task completion when compared to traditional massed training.",2013,NA,Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine,15,NA,S7-S8,NA,NA,8442,Khan 2013,NA,NA,1,0

I.","In 1987 an epidemic of diarrhea associated with adult diarrhea rotavirus (ADRV) occurred in Qinhuangdao City, China, affecting more than 200 persons and causing 2 deaths. The outbreak was introduced by a person returning from an epidemic area and was spread initially to his family members and subsequently to the entire community. Adults were at greater risk of diarrhea than children 0-4 y of age and, the duration of illness increased significantly with increasing age. ADRV was identified by ELISA and electron microscopy. The electropherotypes of all positive specimens were identical, consistent with the single point-source introduction of the virus. Seroconversion was detected in 6 of 7 ill persons with a blocking ELISA. Both asymptomatic infection and person-to-person spread identified in this epidemic suggest that current emphasis on preventing waterborne transmission may not control the introduction of ADRV into new areas. The predisposition of adults for more severe disease with ADRV is similar to the pattern observed with other enteric viruses such as the Norwalk agent and hepatitis A.",1989,NA,The Journal of infectious diseases,160,6,948-53,NA,NA,11609,Fang 1989,NA,NA,1,0
#3300,Follicular conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis an infant Saharan population: Molecular and clinical diagnosis,"Javaloy, J.; Ferrer, C.; Vidal, M. T.; Alio, J. L.","Aims: To ascertain the prevalence of acute trachoma as a supposed endemic disease among infants in the Saharan refugee camps of Tindouf (Algeria) and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with a single dose of azithromycin. Methods: 527 children aged between 3 and 17 were evaluated in the camp schools in October 2001. All the children were clinically and microbiologically examined, including slit lamp checks of anterior segment and two conjunctival swabs, one for the detection of membrane lipopolysaccharide by quick immunoassay test Clearview Chlamydia MF and the other for the detection of specific DNA by chlamydia plasmid specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. After examination, a single dose of azithromycin was administered to each child. One month later samples from positive children and 12 random negative children by the first PCR were taken to perform a new PCR assay. Results: Chlamydia trachomatis was suspected in 2.47% of the children, papillary hypertrophy being the most frequently seen clinical sign. Scarring changes secondary to trachoma were detected in 11.7% of the children. Only four cases (0.8%) were positive to the immunoassay test and 12 cases (2.27%) were positive by PCR. After treatment a second PCR was performed on positive children and they were negative of chlamydia DNA amplification. However, one child who was negative and received the treatment was positive in the second PCR assay. Conclusion: Acute trachoma prevalence is much lower than expected among infants in this Saharan population. The possible reasons could be the recent improvements in hygiene and health care. Cicatricial trachoma is more frequent. The Clearview immunoassay test has very low sensitivity in the detection of this disease. A single dose of azithromycin is sufficient to treat chlamydial conjunctivitis.

The League assumed a role that the State would not, and for the next 25 years organized the country's anti-malaria campaign. During its first steps, the Greek Anti-Malaria League adopted the principles of Professor Angelo Celli's Italian Anti-Malaria League. The League's accomplishments include a decrease in malarial prevalence, due to mass treatment with quinine, new legislation ensuring the provision of quinine, State monopoly and the collection of epidemiologic data. However, defeat in the Greek-Turkish War (1922) and the massive influx of one million Greek refugees that ensued, led to a change in malarial epidemiology. In 1928, following a visit to Italy, the Greek League adopted the organization and knowledge of the Italian Malaria Schools in Rome and in Nettuno, and this experience served as the basis of their proposal to the State for the development of the anti-malaria services infrastructure. The State adopted many of Professor Savvas' proposals and modified his plan according to Greek needs.

#3272,The impact of environmental pollution on congenital anomalies,"Dolk, H.; Vrijheid, M.","Major congenital anomalies are diagnosed in 2-4% of births. In this paper we review epidemiological studies that have specifically looked at congenital anomalies as a possible outcome of community exposure to chemical exposures associated with environmental pollution. These include studies of drinking water contaminants (heavy metals and nitrates, chlorinated and aromatic solvents, and chlorination by-products), residence near waste disposal sites and contaminated land, pesticide exposure in agricultural areas, air pollution and industrial pollution sources, food contamination, and disasters involving accidental, negligent or deliberate chemical releases of great magnitude. We conclude that there are relatively few environmental pollution exposures for which we can draw strong conclusions about the potential to cause congenital anomalies and, if so, the chemical constituents implicated, to provide an evidence base for public health and clinical practice. A precautionary approach should be adopted at both community and individual level. In order to prevent congenital anomalies, one must reduce exposure to potential teratogens before pregnancy is recognized (i.e. preconceptionally and in the first few weeks of pregnancy). It is a challenge to develop effective strategies for preconceptional care within the primary care framework.

#6404,Persistence of DNA from laundered semen stains: Implications for child sex trafficking cases,"Brayley-Morris, H.; Sorrell, A.; Revoir, A. P.; Meakin, G. E.; Court, D. S.; Morgan, R. M.","In sexual assault cases, particularly those involving internal child sex trafficking (ICST), victims often hide their semen-stained clothing. This can result in a lag time of several months before the items are laundered and subsequently seized during a criminal investigation. Although it has been demonstrated previously that DNA can be recovered from clothing washed immediately after semen deposition, laundered items of clothing are not routinely examined in ICST cases, due to the assumption that the time delay and washing would result in no detectable DNA. The aim of this study was to examine whether viable DNA profiles could be recovered from laundered semen stains where there has been a significant lag time between semen deposition from one or more individuals and one or more washes of the stained clothing. Items of UK school uniform (T-shirts, trousers, tights) were stained with fresh semen (either from a single donor or a 1:1 mixture from two donors) and stored in a wardrobe for eight months. Stained and unstained items (socks) were then washed at 30 degreeC or 60 degreeC and with non-biological or biological detergent. DNA samples extracted from the semen-stained sites and from the unstained socks were quantified and profiled. High quantities of DNA, (6-18 mug) matching the DNA profiles of the semen donors, were recovered from all semen-stained clothing that had been laundered once, irrespective of wash conditions. This quantity,and profile quality,did not decline significantly with multiple washes. The two donor semen samples yielded ~10-fold more DNA from the T-shirts than from the trousers. This disparity resulted in the T-shirts yielding a ~1:1 mixture of DNA from the two donors, whereas the trousers yielded a major DNA profile matching only that of the second donor. The quantities of DNA recovered from the unstained socks were an order of magnitude lower, with most of the DNA being attributable to the donor of the semen on the stained clothing within the same wash, demonstrating the transfer of semen-derived DNA among items of clothing in the washing machine. This study demonstrates that complete DNA profiles can be obtained from laundered semen stains on school uniform-type clothing, with an eight-month lag time between semen deposition and laundering, despite multiple washes and stains from two semen donors.

Dose-response relationships were tested with Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (alpha = 0.05). S. Enteritidis isolates were cultured and phage-typed. Information was available for 11 out of 14 individuals attending the barbecue; all were healthy young adults (median age 27 years). The attack rate was 100%. Three cases were hospitalized and two developed acute pancreatitis. The exposure common to all cases was a vegetable pasta salad that had been stored unrefrigerated for 23 h. Consuming higher doses was associated with longer median symptom duration (7 days vs. 4 days, P = 0.11). S. Enteritidis was found in the stools of nine barbecue guests.

#5488,"Women's Health and Hygiene Experiences During Deployment to the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, 2003 through 2010","Doherty, Mary Ellen; Scannell-Desch, Elizabeth","Introduction: The purpose of this study was to describe women's health and hygiene experiences during their deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan during the war years, 2003 through 2010. Methods: A phenomenological method described the essential structures embedded in the women's health and hygiene experiences. Colaizzi's method of data analysis was used to guide the discovery of themes. Interview data were gathered from 24 interviews with military nurses who served in the war zones. Female military nurses were specifically selected for this study because of their insight, awareness, and knowledge base. Results: Seven themes emerged from the data and captured the essence of the women's experiences: 1) bathroom trips and facilities: a walk on the wild side; 2) shower challenges: lack of privacy, water problems, and location issues; 3) menstruation: to suppress or not to suppress; 4) staying clean: a monumental task; 5) various infections: annoying distractions; 6) unintended pregnancies: wartime surprises; and 7) safety issues: enemy attacks and sexual assaults. Discussion: In the current military structure, more women are being deployed to combat zones and will endure the challenges and hardships described in this study. The health and hygiene experiences of deployed women are an important part of their daily lives in combat zones. Educational programs and clinical services need to be tailored to this cadre of women, with focused attention on preparation and anticipatory guidance prior to deployment. Access to health promotion and appropriate clinical services during deployment is critical. Finally, as these women return home as veterans, it is important for all providers to understand the contextual framework of their service and its impact on their lives.",2012,NA,Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health,57,2,172-177,104538127.

#3380,"Spatial and temporal distribution of mosquitoes in underground storm drain systems in Orange County, California","Su, T.; Webb, J. P.; Meyer, R. P.; Mulla, M. S.","Underground storm drain systems in urban areas of Orange County include thousands of miles of gutters and underground pipelines, plus hundreds of thousands of catch basins and manhole chambers, all of which drain runoff water from residential, business and commercial establishments as well as highways and streets. These systems serve as major developmental and resting sites for anthropophilic and zoophilic mosquitoes. Investigations on spatial and temporal distribution of mosquitoes in these systems were conducted during November 1999 to October 2001. Immature mosquitoes were sampled by dipper or dipping net and adult mosquitoes by non-attractive CDC traps in manhole chambers, catch basins and a large drain. Culex quinquefasciatus Say prevailed at all 15 structures of the study in 4 cities of Orange County as the predominant species (> 99.9%). Larvae and pupae were present from April to October, peaking from May to September. The population density of adults was the lowest in February with 2 peaks of abundance occurring from May to July and from September to October. Manhole chambers and catch basins harbored more mosquitoes than did the large drain. Minimum and maximum temperatures during a 24 h sampling period was an important factor influencing adult mosquito activity and catches; more mosquitoes were caught in traps when it was warmer, especially when the minimum temperatures were higher. The proportion of females to males in general increased during winter and early spring an ddeclined during summer.The proportion of gravid females to empty females was higher during the winter than in summer. Other dipteran taxa such as psychodid moth flies and chironomid midges exhibited somewhat similar seasonal patterns as did mosquito populations. Average water temperature was relatively stable throughout the year, and water quality in underground drain systems was characterized by low dissolved oxygen, coupled with above normal electrical conductivity and salinity levels that were more pronounced during the summer. The episodes of measurable rains that occurred during the winter months (February and March) reduced mosquito population density (both larvae and adults) and altered water quality in the underground drain systems.",2003,NA,Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology,28,1,79-89,NA,NA,9854,Su 2003,NA,NA,0,0
#7123,Container gardens to meet vegetable needs during dry season for reproductive age women and their children in northern Ghana,Kubuga C.K.; Song S.; Kennedy G.; Lee K.W.; Song W.O.,"Food insecurity is very high in northern Ghana and the largest proportion of food insecure households is reported in Upper East region. The situation compounds high burden of malnutrition and notably endemic iron deficiency anemia which worsen during the prolonged dry season when staple nutrient-rich vegetables (e.g. Hibiscus sabdariffa), cereals and legumes/pulse are limited. Inhabitants are largely subsistent farmers of low socioeconomic status; consume monotonous diets consisting of staple cereals, vegetables and legumes with no or little animal products. The Upper East region has a typical savannah woodland vegetation characterized by short scattered drought-resistant trees and grass. It has two main seasons: a 7-8 mo dry season (October-April) and a 4-5 mo rainy season (May-September). We aimed to investigate the feasibility of producing widely consumed iron rich vegetables (Hibiscus sabdariffa) using container garden during the dry season to overcome limited irrigation capacity and access to land. We also investigated the feasibility of generating income to sustain the garden and purchasing micronutrient rich foods (dry fish and iodized salt). Fifty five women from a community based feeding trial were recruited in May 2016 and grouped by their respective communities for the garden containers: Sakaa (n=27) and Chania (n=28). Twenty containers/community were used for hibiscus sabdariffa production and 7 to 8 containers/community for income-generating cabbage production. Containers were assembled in the respective community health centers and fenced. Each community had a small plastic water reservoir for water drawn from a community borehole for watering of vegetables. Groups were given training on container gardening by an experienced gardener. We demonstrated two harvesting cycles (4 wks and 8 wks) for hibiscus sabdariffa and one cycle (14 wks) for cabbage. Hibiscus was harvested by 48 kg and 46 kg in Sakaa (mean 2.3kg of hibiscus/container/cycle) and 34 kg and 33 kg in Chania (mean 1.7 kg of hibiscus/container/cycle). Cabbage heads were harvested by 75 pieces (Sakaa) and 58 pieces (Chania) for marketing to pre-arranged buyers in food service sector and to the open markets. We found that one container is capable of providing motherchild dyad at least 3 hibiscus meals/week and income from one container for cabbage could meet dyad's monthly needs for iodize salt and fish consumption. The results suggest that the container garden would be able to provide hibiscus sabdariffa in the dry season, provide dietary iron and income adequate enough to purchase iodized salt and dry fish.",2017,/,FASEB Journal,31,1 Supplement 1,NA,NA,NA,616960203,Kubuga 2017,NA,Search2018,0,0

This is a descriptive report of patients who presented for medical attention at an annual electronic dance music festival (EDMF). At this large, single EDMF in New York City (NYC; New York, USA), the frequency of patient presentation, the range of presentations, and interventions performed were identified. This descriptive report examined consecutive patients who presented to the medical tent of a summertime EDMF held at an outdoor venue with an active, mobile, bounded crowd. Alcohol was available for sale. Entry was restricted to persons 18 years and older. The festival occurred on three consecutive days with a total cumulative attendance of 58,000. Medical staffing included two Emergency Medicine physicians, four registered nurses, and 86 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers. Data collected included demographics, past medical history, vital signs, physical exam, drug and alcohol use, interventions performed, and transport decisions. Eighty-four patients were enrolled over 2.5 days. Six were transported and zero died. The ages of the subjects ranged from 17 to 61 years. Forty-three (51%) were male. Thirty-eight (45%) initially presented with abnormal vital signs; four (5%) were hyperthermic. Of these latter patients, 34 (90%) reported ingestions with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or other drugs. Eleven (65%) patients were diaphoretic or mydriatic. The most common prehospital interventions were intravenous normal saline (8/84; 10%), ondansetron (6/84; 7%), and midazolam (3/84; 4%). Electronic dance music festivals are a growing trend and a new challenge for Mass-Gathering Medicine as new strategies must be employed to decrease TTHR and mortality. Addressing common and expected medical emergencies at mass-gathering events through awareness, preparation, and early, focused medical interventions may decrease PPR, TTHR, and overall mortality.

L.; Cobaugh, D. J.; Chyka, P. A.; Scharman, E. J.; Manoguerra, A. S.; Troutman, W. G.","The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with suspected exposures to elemental mercury. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and health professionals providing care. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. Recommendations: 1) Patients with exposure due to suspected self-harm, abuse, misuse, or potentially malicious administration should be referred to an emergency department immediately regardless of the exposure reported (Grade D). 2) Patients with symptoms of acute elemental mercury poisoning (e.g., cough, dyspnea, chest pain) should be referred immediately to an emergency department for evaluation regardless of the reported dose. Patients with symptoms of chronic toxicity (rash, tremor, weight loss, etc.) should be referred for healthcare evaluation, the timing and location of which is guided by the severity of illness and circumstances of the exposure (Grade C). 3) If the elemental mercury was recently heated (e.g., from stove top, oven, furnace) in an enclosed area, all people within the exposure area should be evaluated at a healthcare facility due to the high risk of toxicity (Grade C). 4) If the elemental mercury was vacuumed or swept with a broom, the health department should be contacted to perform an environmental assessment for mercury contamination. Consider healthcare referral for those exposed to documented high air mercury concentrations (Grade C). 5) Patients ingesting more mercury than in a household fever thermometer or those with abdominal pain after ingestion should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). Do not induce emesis or administer activated charcoal. 6) Asymptomatic patients with brief, unintentional, low-dose vapor exposures can be observed at home. Asymptomatic patients can be evaluated as non-urgent outpatients if there is concern for exposures to high doses (e.g., more than contained in a thermometer) or for chronic duration (Grade D). 7) Pregnant patients unintentionally exposed to elemental mercury and who are asymptomatic should be evaluated by their obstetrician or primary care provider as an outpatient. Immediate referral to an ED is not required (Grade D). 8) Patients with elemental mercury deposited or injected into soft tissue should be referred for evaluation of surgical removal (Grade C). 9) All elemental mercury spills should be properly cleaned up, including the small amount of mercury from a broken thermometer. Brooms and vacuum cleaners should not be used to clean up elemental mercury. The clean-up of any spill larger than a broken thermometer should be performed by a professional company, state health department, or the EPA. Detailed instructions are provided on the EPA website: www.epa.gov/ epaoswer/hazwaste/mercury/faq/spills.htm (Grade D). 10) Patients with dermal exposures should remove all jewelry and wash the affected area with mild soap and water. Remove all contaminated clothing and place these items in a sealed plastic double-bag for proper disposal (Grade D). 11) Do not discard elemental mercury in household trash, plumbing drains, or sewer systems. Consult local authorities for the proper disposal of low-level elemental mercury-contaminated household items and thermometers (Grade D).

Any isolation of VDPV2 after the switch is to be treated as a potential public health emergency and might indicate the need for supplementary immunization activities (3,4). On August 9, 2016, VDPV2 was isolated from a sewage sample taken from an environmental surveillance site in Hyderabad, Sindh province, Pakistan. Possible vaccination activities in response to VDPV2 isolation include the use of injectable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which poses no risk for vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission. Fractional-dose, intradermal IPV (fIPV), one fifth of the standard intramuscular dose, has been developed to more efficiently manage limited IPV supplies. fIPV has been shown in some studies to be noninferior to full-dose IPV (5,6) and was used successfully in response to a similar detection of a single VDPV2 isolate from sewage in India (7). Injectable fIPV was used for response activities in Hyderabad and three neighboring districts.

Rotavirus was detected in 94 of the 1,056 fecal specimens collected from January 1998 to December 1999. Among the 13 discernible long electrophoretic profiles found, one was highly prevalent (73.4%) and represented the rotavirus strain responsible for the May-August winter epidemic outbreak of 1998, as clearly shown in a three-dimensional graph. This epidemic strain, designated JF98, was characterized as subgroup II and genotype G3P[4] by the original reverse transcription-PCR typing assays. Besides the unusual combination of G and P types, this G3 strain lacked reactivity with anti-G3-specific monoclonal antibodies and presented an uncommon pattern upon digestion of its cDNA-copied VP7 gene with the BstYI restriction enzyme. Strain JF98 affected primarily 6- to 24-month-old children and accounted for 85.5% of the severe rotavirus-associated dehydrating diarrhea cases that required hospitalization.

After initial description in 2001 of unrelated VRE isolates, we report now the molecular characterization of a nosocomial outbreak at the Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya, Turkey., METHODS: VRE isolates were from either clinical or rectal swab specimens. Identification, susceptibility testing and molecular characterization were performed according to standard techniques. Virulence genes (encoding aggregation substance, gelatinase, cytolysin, enterococcal surface protein and hyaluronidase) were sought by PCR., RESULTS: Thirty-six VRE were isolated from 10 patients between June and October 2005 in the Department of Paediatrics. Six patients were only carriers, two had urinary tract infections and two had bloodstream infections. All isolates were Enterococcus faecium, of vanA genotype and belonged either to a main pulsotype (A) or to three minor pulsotypes (B, C and D). The epidemic strain A, found in eight patients, expressed high-level glycopeptide resistance (MIC of vancomycin 256 mg/L and MIC of teicoplanin 64 mg/L) and was of multilocus sequence typing sequence type (ST) 31, whereas the minor strain D, found in two patients, expressed heterogeneous glycopeptide resistance (MIC of vancomycin 8 to 256 mg/L) and was ST18. Strains B and C were only found in single patients either with strain A or alone. The two epidemic strains A and D were esp gene-positive. Their vanA genes were located on transposons similar to Tn1546, except for deletion of the transposition genes and the presence of IS1542, inserted upstream of the vanA operon, and IS1216, inserted at the 3' end of the vanX gene.

#1947,Epidemiology and spectrum of vibrio diarrheas in the lower cross river basin of Nigeria,"Eko, F. O.; Udo, S. M.; Antia-Obong, O. E.","In 1991 a cholera epidemic occurred in Nigeria. The features of this cholera outbreak in a single hospital in Cross River, Nigeria, were examined. Microbiologic techniques included the use of thiosulphate citrate bile-salts sucrose (TCBS) medium for culture of all stool specimens. Vibrio isolates from diarrheic patients included V. cholerae-O1 (75), V. cholerae non-O1 (10) and V. parahaemolyticus (21). The illnesses were diverse, ranging from mild to severe, and in most instances requiring hospitalization, rehydration as well as antibiotic treatment. Eighty patients were hospitalized and six died mainly from hypovolemic shock and acute renal failure arising from excessive fluid loss. The low vibrio-associated mortality observed in this outbreak may have been influenced by the proximity and easy transit access to the health care facilities offered by the teaching hospital. This contrasts with the high mortality figures reported by Health Centers in the rural areas during the same period. Some features of vibrio diarrheas were comparable with those of other enteric pathogens. Poorly developed water and sewage disposal systems, contact with sea water, consumption of fishery products and leftover foods were the main risk factors identified.",1994,NA,Central European journal of public health,2,1,37-41,NA,NA,11538,Eko 1994,NA,NA,1,0

H.; Leventhal, A.","On-site wastewater management system design and performance is significant in assessing landslide risk in areas with potential for slope instability. Much of the development in Pittwater, NSW, local government area is on steep coastal land which has a history of slope instability. Concern over cases of poorly performing or failing on-site wastewater systems and the recognition that these and newly designed systems could be contributory to slope instability has been a factor in Pittwater Council, NSW, requiring that landslide risk assessment be undertaken for new and amended on-site wastewater management systems in potentially unstable areas. This paper describes the wastewater management system design and landslide risk assessment undertaken at Pittwater Youth Hostel in accordance with the Australian Geomechanics Society's Geotechnical Risk Management procedure to comply with the Pittwater Policy.

Treatment arms were a single milk and molasses enema in the ED or PEG 3350 for 3 days outpatient. Telephone follow-up was done on days 1, 3, and 5. The primary outcome was main symptom improvement. Additional outcomes were stool frequency, consistency, and ease of stool passage. Treatment failures (home enema, ED return, or hospital admission) were tracked., RESULTS: Seventy-nine subjects participated (39 PEG; 40 enema). At day 1, PEG subjects were less likely to have improved main symptom (odds ratio [OR], 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-0.8) but no difference in other outcomes. Half (54%) in enema arm were reported as upset by ED therapy, whereas no children in PEG arm were upset (P < 0.05). At day 3, more patients in enema arm reported ideal stool consistency (74% vs 38%; P < 0.05). At day 5, no difference between groups was noted.

The disease affected the premature babies who suffered from gastroenterities. The infection started in one premature baby room and soon spread to all other premature baby rooms in the hospital. Though the disease affected only the premature babies, there was widespread contamination of the environment and a large reservoir of asymptomatic infections amongst the staff and healthy babies. Initially the spread of infection would have been by person-to-person transfer, but subsequently the rapid spread was probably through the piped water supply contaminated as a result of suction of waste water into the water mains. The organism appeared to grow in the interior of the water tap in that zone which is in contact with the atmosphere and also in the walls of the water tanks at the water level. When the plumbing defect which permitted the contamination was rectified, the organism disappeared from the taps and the infection rapidly subsided. Subsequently all the tanks were cleaned and disinfected.

Either random or universal sampling was applied in the selection of health facilities assessed. Local nurses and midwives participated in the data collection and, to some extent, data processing and analysis., RESULTS: The coverage of basic EmOC services ranged 0-1.1/500,000 population compared to the UN-recommended level of 4/500,000. The coverage of comprehensive EmOC services ranged 0.5-4.3/500,000 compared to the recommended level of 1/500,000. Between 0.6% and 8.8% of all births took place in EmOC facilities, and 2.1% and 18.5% of all expected direct obstetric complications were treated. Cesarean section as a proportion of all births was between 0.1% and 1%. Shortage of trained staff especially mid-level providers, poor basic infrastructure such as lack of electricity and water supplies, inadequate supply of drugs and essential equipment, poor working conditions and staff morale, lack of communication and referral facilities, cost of treatment, and lack of accountability and proper management were identified as the main obstacles in providing 24-h quality EmOC services especially in remote and rural areas., CONCLUSIONS: Lack of basic EmOC services limits women's access to life-saving services during obstetric complications.

DESIGN: Epidemiological investigation, including screening for HCV of hospitalized patients, and a retrospective cohort study, review of hygiene and medical practices, and molecular comparison of HCV isolates. SETTING: A specialized care unit for cystic fibrosis (CF) and diabetic patients at an acute-care facility in the south of France. RESULTS: Of the 57 CF patients (age in 1995: 2-28 years), 38 (66.7%) were tested and 22 (57.9%) were anti-HCV positive. Eight (50%) of 16 patients with anti-HCV antibody tested by polymerase chain reaction were viremic. No patients had received blood products or had any history of intravenous drug use. All 18 (100%) patients with CF who had ever undergone self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose in the unit were anti-HCV positive, compared to 4 (20%) of 20 who had not (relative risk, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-12.0). Seventy (39.5%) of the patients with diabetes were screened for anti-HCV; 12 (18.8%) tested positive, with 3 (25%) positive for HCV-RNA. Patients with diabetes had routine capillary blood glucose monitoring while hospitalized and shared with CF patients the same spring-triggered devices for capillary blood glucose monitoring.

On July 14 2008, AGES was informed of a cluster of 22 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with S. sonnei restricted to public health district X in the province of Salzburg. All cases had attended a youth-group trip to a small village in the province of Tyrol from July 7 to July 9. An outbreak case among the trip participants was a person who (1) attended the trip and (2) fell ill with diarrhea in the period between July 8 and July 12. Among the 61 trip participants, 42 fitted the outbreak case definition, including 31 culture-confirmed cases.

#7183,Selection of DNA aptamers specific for live Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Soundy J.; Day D.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particular cystic fibrosis sufferers, burns victims, diabetics and neonates. It thrives in moist places where it forms biofilms that are exceedingly difficult to eradicate on hospital surfaces, in water supplies and implanted bio-materials. Using a live cell SELEX approach we selected DNA aptamers to P. aeruginosa grown as biofilms in microfluidic cells. From a pool of aptamer candidates showing tight binding a stem-loop structure was identified as being important for binding. Enhanced binding and increased specificity was achieved by truncating structures and generating chimeric aptamers from the pool of top candidates. The top candidates have low nanomolar binding constants and high discrimination for P. aeruginosa over other Gram-negative bacteria. The aptamers bind both planktonic grown and biofilm grown cells. They do not have intrinsic bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity, but are ideal candidates for modification for use as aptamer-drug conjugates and in biosensors.Copyright © 2017 Soundy, Day.

Understanding the prevalence and types of HAdV in diarrhoea is important for control and preventive measures, especially in the African region where there is a high burden of diarrhoeal disease. The present study assessed the prevalence, molecular characteristics, seasonality and associated clinical features of HAdV infection Tanzanian children below two years of age with and without diarrhoea between 2010-2011., METHODS: Stool specimens, demographic and clinical information were collected in 690 cases and 545 controls. All stool samples were screened for HAdV-antigen using ELISA. Positive samples subsequently underwent real-time PCR and sequencing for molecular typing., RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 37 children, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.5% (24/690) in diarrhoeic and 2.4% (13/545) in non-diarrhoeic children (P>0.05). Among HAdV-infected children, the median age was significantly lower in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic children (10 vs. 14 months, P<0.001). More than half of HAdV infected (54.2%) were dehydrated as compared to diarrhoeic children without HAdV (45.8%, P=0.01). The proportion of the enteric HAdV type 40/41 in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic children was (50.0%, 12/24) and (46.2%, 6/13) respectively. Other HAdV types detected were; 1, 2, 7, 18, 19 and 31. The prevalence of adenovirus was not significantly different between rainy and dry seasons. HAdV was not detected in the 33 known HIV positive children. There was no significant association between HAdV infection and gender, nutritional status of the child and parent educational level., CONCLUSION: The present study provides further evidence of the contribution of adenovirus in causing gastroenteritis in young children, with symptomatic infection being significantly more prevalent in children below one year. We found similar prevalence of adenovirus in non-diarrhoeic children and in diarrhoeic children. This first report on molecular epidemiology of human adenovirus in Tanzania observed diversity of HAdV types that circulate the study setting.

#4123,Nutritional status in postconflict Afghanistan: Evidence from the National Surveillance System Pilot and National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment,"Johnecheck, W. A.; Holland, D. E.","Background. Two large-scale studies, the National Surveillance System (NSS) Pilot Study (2003-2004) and the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) 2003, were conducted by government, United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations in Afghanistan, as part of wider efforts characterizing Afghan livelihoods in relation to particular outcomes of interest: vulnerability to poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. Objective. To present the data from these two surveys with nutrition as the key outcome of interest, and to further construct the understanding of the underlying causes of malnutrition, thus providing public health practitioners and other sector specialists with insight into how a variety of sectoral programs can impact nutritional outcomes in Afghanistan. Methods. The NSS gathered information on livelihoods, food security, and nutrition from 20 to 40 randomly selected households in each of 26 purposively selected sentinel sites (representative of livelihood zones) during November-December 2003 and May-June 2004. The NRVA gathered information nationally from households selected with a two-stage sampling (based on livelihood zone and then socioeconomic group) during July-September 2004. Results. Acute malnutrition is below emergency levels for children under five. The level of chronic malnutrition in children underfive indicates a problem of public health importance. Dietary diversity in Afghanistan is not as low as expected but still shows roomfor improvement, particularly in remote areas and with respect to food groups associated with adequate micronutrient intake. The findings also suggest that in addition to lack of adequate householdfood intake, recurrent illness and suboptimal infant and young child feeding and hygiene practices contribute to poor nutritional outcomes in this age group. The survey also found poor access to health care, markets, and waterfor household use. Conclusions. Improving nutritional status requires a multipronged approach, directly targeting malnutrition, coupled with economic growth, household livelihood security, social protection, access to public health services, and water and sanitation.

#65,Epidemic diarrhea of the newborn (neonatal enteritis),"Sauer, L. W.","A description is given of an epidemic in a nursery for children awaiting adoption, in 1927. Two case histories are presented where the prodromal symptoms were lack of appetite, increase in the number of stools, and progressive daily weight loss. The most frequent sequence of cardinal symptoms was: vomiting, abdominal distension, ashen gray colour, listlessness, precipitate loss of weight, watery stools, and toxicity. Drastic precautionary measures were instituted to render food and supplies safe by sterilization, and a strict individual aseptic nursing technique is described in detail. Since the introduction of these measures infants with epidemic diarrhoea have been admitted to the nursery and no secondary cases have occurred in the past 18 years.",1947,NA,Illinois Medical Journal,91,4,201-204,NA,NA,9576,Sauer 1947,NA,NA,1,0
#5970,Amplification of patient safety and infection prevention systems in Southwest Uganda: The power of district based in-hospital training,"Spillman, I.; Ahimbisibwe, M.; Fry, A.; Syed, S. B.; Hoyle, S.; Walker, S.; Tumwesigye, T.","Introduction: Kisiizi Hospital (KH) in partnership with Countess of Chester Hospital UK, as part of WHO African Partnerships for Patient Safety (APPS) has developed a programme to amplify crucial patient safety improvements to other district health facilities. Objectives: To describe an effective replicable mechanism of amplification of APPS. Methods: Using co-developed APPS resources, including in-house videos and demonstrations, training targeted all hospitals, training schools, and health centre IV's within Rukungiri and Kabale districts. A Sensitisation Day aimed at key leaders of institutions was followed by a 2-day Training of Trainers seminar for those chosen to implement APPS principles. Patient safety, healthcare associated infections, hand hygiene, safe prescribing, WHO Safe Surgical Checklist, medical waste management, triage, monitoring, evaluation and teaching methods were covered, complimented by a tour of KH. Evaluations were completed and site-specific implementation plans formulated. Post-event site follow-up assessing progress with specific implementation goals is scheduled. Results: Training achieved 100% coverage for health centre IVs, hospitals, and district staff. In addition another regional hospital, two health educators, and four colleagues from Ndola Hospital, Zambia participated. Attendee evaluation was positive with 61% of attendees rating ten out of ten for overall quality of training. The tour and the varied methodologies utilised scored very highly. Conclusion: Key lessons emerge. First, success of regional coverage was due to good promotion and the innovative use of a ""Sensitisation Day"" to motivate leaders of institutions followed by appropriate staff selection to ensure implementation. Second, the Uganda-Zambia link enriched the training and proved mutually beneficial. Third, locating the seminars at an APPS hospital proved valuable in reality-focused training. Finally, comprehensive electronic resource compilation including in-house videos can provide support for on-going implementation. The process and amplification materials used can be replicated in other districts in Uganda and Africa to enhance patient safety.",2013,NA,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,9791,Spillman 2013,NA,NA,0,0

#43,Effects of war conditions on child health,"Ellis, R. W. B.","The attention paid to the protection of child health during the war years in almost every country involved was of the utmost social significance. The results of this attention are impossible to assess statistically, but the measures taken may be discussed under three headings. (1) Mass refugee movement. Diseases of greatest significance to the refugee child are typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, pediculosis, impetigo, and scabies. It is difficult to estimate how far the period of nutritional deprivation under war conditions has been directly responsible for fatal tuberculosis. (2) Enemy occupation. (3) Intensive aerial bombardment. Evacuation of children was carried out on the largest scale in England and Wales. This involved problems in the reception areas in regard to finding of homes, re-organizing food and milk supplies, extending of existing social services. It affected hospital accommodations, welfare clinics, water supplies, sewerage disposal, and the provision of maternity services. Delinquency, truancy, enuresis, or other behaviour disorders appeared more or less directly due to the instability of this background and frequently made the child one that could not be billeted in a private home. These received special handling in children's colonies, with results which varied greatly, depending upon the quality of the housemother and staff. Infants and preschool children were as far as possible kept with their mothers. The effect of a rigid blackout on child health, especially in hospitals and nurseries, was undoubtedly great. It was usually impossible to combine black-out conditions with adequate ventilation. In reconclusion the author recommends two measures undertaken to sustain child health during the war - the making of safe milk freely available to children and nursing and expectant mothers, and the provision of school meals. The available evidence suggests that in at least a few urban areas, the mean height and weight of elementary school children actually improved rather than deteriorated during the war years.",1947,NA,Proceedings of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic,22,40,441-447,NA,NA,7802,Ellis 1947,NA,NA,1,0

I.; Taylor, K. D.; Torres, E. A.","The ""Hygiene hypothesis"" states that individuals raised in sanitary environments are more at risk to have inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Evidence includes the higher incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in Europe and Northern America after World War II. The hypothesis suggests that modern living conditions can lead to defective maturation of regulatory T cells and antigen presenting cells, which cause aberrant immune response to commensal bacteria. However, the relationship between environmental factors and serological markers of IBD has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to test the association between childhood environmental factors with serological markers in adult CD patients in Puerto Rico. Method: Epidemiological data from 152 subjects with CD obtained from questionnaires completed for a collaborative genetic epidemiologic study between the University of Puerto Rico and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, as part of the NIDDK IBD GRC. The diagnosis of CD was based on established criteria that included clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histopathologic criteria. Childhood epidemiological data included urban versus rural living, running water, toilet inside the house and connection to public sewer. Serological markers, including the level of ASCA, anit-OmpC, anti-I2, anti-Cbir and ANCA, were tested by ELISA. Results: Living in rural area had a lower ASCA level than living in urban area (median (EU): 1.26 vs. 1.54, p=0.01; quartile(1-4): p trend=0.005 ); however, having running water (median:1.48 vs. 0.88, p=0.06; quartile: p=0.04), toilet inside the house (median: 1.5 vs. 1.2, p=0.08; quartile: p=0.06), public sewer (median: 1.54 vs. 1.29, p=0.06; quartile: p=0.04) had a higher ASCA expression. Interestingly, having running water (median (EU): anti-I2: 26.5 vs. 59.1, p=0.07; quartile: p=0.04), toilet inside the house (median (EU): anti-I2: 26.1 vs. 54.8, p=0.08; quartile: p=0.06; anti-OmpC: 17.7 vs. 25.9, p=0.01; quartile: p=0.02) was associated with lower expression of anti-I2 or anti-OmpC. We then put environmental score (rural living +1,running water -1,toilet -1,sewerser-vice -1, range:-3 to1) into regression analysis and found significant association with ASCA(p= 0.006, Rsquare=5%), anti-OmpC(p=0.03, Rsquare =3%) and quartile sum of anti-I2 and anti-OmpC(p=0.02, Rsquare=3.3%). Conclusion: environmental exposure in childhood is associated with variation of the antibody expression in CD. The 'clean' environment is positively associated with ASCA expression but negatively associated with anti-OmpC and anti-I2 in CD. The results also suggest potential different pathophysiology of CD in rural and urban areas.",2009,NA,Gastroenterology,136,5 SUPPL. 1,A354,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085%2809%2961622-X,8875,Mei 2009,NA,NA,0,0

The 746,000 people living in the water distribution area were advised to boil their drinking water. Investigations did not reveal how oocysts entered the borehole. This is the first published report of a cryptosporidium outbreak caused by filtered borehole water and we believe it to be the largest outbreak due to groundwater to have been reported.

Thirty-seven strains of poliomyelitis virus were isolated from 721 healthy contacts (5.1%): 20 strains belonged to type 1, 7 to type 2 and 10 to type 3. The low percentage of isolates from contacts might be explained by the following factors: The investigation was conducted in the inter epidemic period when the agent was not disseminated as widely as during seasons of poliomyelitis. The culture of embryonic human muscle tissue was used for the isolation of viruses, which is less susceptible to poliomyelitis virus than HeLa cells or monkey kidney tissue cultures. The cultures were infected with as little as 0.1-0.2 ml. of faeces suspension. The strains of type 1 were demonstrated in 7 foci of infection, the strains of type 2 in 3 foci and the strains of type 3 in 5 foci.

#5508,Parental environment changes the dormancy state and karrikinolide response of Brassica tournefortii seeds,"Gorecki, M. J.; Long, R. L.; Flematti, G. R.; Stevens, J. C.","Background and AimsThe smoke-derived chemical karrikinolide (KAR1) shows potential as a tool to synchronize the germination of seeds for weed management and restoration. To assess its feasibility we need to understand why seeds from different populations of a species exhibit distinct responses to KAR1. Environmental conditions during seed development, known as the parental environment, influence seed dormancy so we predicted that parental environment would also drive the KAR1-responses of seeds. Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) a common environment will unify the KAR1-responses of different populations, (b) a single population grown under different environmental conditions will exhibit different KAR1-responses, and (c) drought stress, as a particular feature of the parental environment, will make seeds less dormant and more responsive to KAR1. MethodsSeeds of the weed Brassica tournefortii were collected from four locations in Western Australia and were sown in common gardens at two field sites, to test whether their KAR1-responses could be unified by a common environment. To test the effects of drought on KAR1-response, plants were grown in a glasshouse and subjected to water stress. For each trial, the germination responses of the next generation of seeds were assessed. Key ResultsThe KAR1-responses of seeds differed among populations, but this variation was reduced when seeds developed in a common environment. The KAR1-responses of each population changed when seeds developed in different environments. Different parental environments affected germination responses of the populations differently, showing that parental environment interacts with genetics to determine KAR1-responses. Seeds from droughted plants were 5 more responsive to KAR1 and 5 less dormant than seeds from well-watered plants, but KAR1-responses and dormancy state were not intrinsically linked in all experiments. ConclusionsThe parental environment in which seeds develop is one of the key drivers of the KAR1-responses of seeds. © The Author 2012.

#4730,Historical investigation of the technological advances in infant cleansing,"Walters, R.; LiBrizzi, J.; Martin, K.; Hamilton, M.","Technological advancements have enabled a continual redefinition appropriate for cleansing for infant skin. Cleansing infants is critical for both infant and family hygiene. We investigate the technical developments in infant cleansing and the new innovations thereby enabled. Each new cleansing technology has produced product innovations that offer milder and healthier ways to cleanse infant skin. Until approximately 1890, most soap was madeby hand; the industrial revolution enabled more consistent and more pure soap. We found that technical advances during both World Wars enabled rapid innovation in the 1940s and 1950s with synthetic detergents - the syndet bar improved the pH compatibility with skin. Following shortly thereafter, liquid surfactant based cleansers allowed for another redefinition of mild cleansing, with less aggressive and pH-neutral systems. The current state of the art in skin mildness for infant cleansing involves the blending of multiple surfactants to create a less aggressive surfactant system that provides reduced skin irritation and reduced eye irritation and stinging. Following the step change in product performance of the 1950s and 1960s, recent efforts have focused on ensuring the quality and safety of infant cleansers. Research has been focused on increased understanding of surfactant interactions with infant skin and novel in vitro methods to access cleanser mildness such as the fluorescein leakage test, skin equivalents, and ocular irritation models.

Epidemic 1 occurred in a rural village near Hangzhou during August 1978-January 1979, and epidemic 2 took place in a rural primary school in Pinghu County in Zhejiang in April-May 1985. These sera were tested for antibodies against hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activity, and icteric index. Feces also were collected in epidemic 1 to test for hepatitis A virus antigen. Both anti-HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and total anti-HAV were assayed in sera from ""healthy persons"" (symptomless persons without icterus and with normal SGPT level) who were in close contact with hepatitis A patients. In epidemic 1, among 18 ""healthy persons"", 12 were anti-HAV IgM positive, two were immune, and four susceptibles escaped infection. In epidemic 2, among 32 ""healthy children"", three were anti-HAV IgM positive, five had been infected by hepatitis A virus in the past, and 24 were not infected. These results demonstrate that inapparent infections occur along with overt and subclinical infections during epidemics of hepatitis A.

D.; Walls, K.","Clinical, serologic, and epidermiologic evidence documents an outbreak of toxoplasmosis involving ten of 30 members of an extended family. The index patient had unusual clinical manifestations including brain abscesses, progressive chorioretinitis, seizures, neurologic deficits, hepatosplenomegaly, pneumonitis, and eosinophilia. Toxoplasmosis was confirmed by demonstrating the organism in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluids; clinical and serologic evidence also indicated infection with Toxocara (viscd children. Of the 11 such children, seven (68%) were seropositive, six of whom had high acute-phase titers (greater than or equal to 1024) to Toxoplasma and a disease consistent with acute toxoplasmosis. All six of the latter group required specific chemotherapy. Geophagia was associated statistically with acute toxoplasmosis among the children; it also increased the risk of infection with Toxocara and enteroparasites. Two school-aged children and two adults had serologic evidence of acute toxoplasmosis, but only one of the group was symptomatic. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that this outbreak was probably caused by ingesting oocysts from cat feces. We suggest that the severe and unusual clinical manifestations of the index patient resulted from simultaneous infection with Toxoplasma and Toxocara.",1980,NA,Pediatrics,65,4,706-12,NA,NA,14280,Stagno 1980,NA,NA,1,0

#2767,Hepatitis A shifting epidemiology in South-East Asia and China,"Barzaga, B. N.","A review of the epidemiology of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection over the last 20 years shows shifting patterns in the prevalence of antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) throughout South-East Asia and China. A number of countries have shifted from high to moderate and from moderate to low endemicity, with a corresponding increase in the age of exposure from childhood to early adulthood. The changes have resulted from improvements in hygiene, sanitation and the quality of drinking water, reflecting improvements in living standards and socioeconomic progress. In general in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 85-95% of the population of developing countries like the Philippines, Korea, China and Thailand were anti-HAV-positive by age 10-15 years, compared with only about 50% in the more affluent countries like Malaysia and Singapore. In the early 1990s, 85-95% of the population were immune by age 30-40 years in the Philippines, Korea, China and Thailand, and by 50 years of age and above in Malaysia and Singapore. Similar trends were noted in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.

#5616,The use of lot quality assurance sampling in the assessment of health and water/sanitation services in a complex humanitarian emergency,"Pham, K.; Jacquet, G.; Vu, A.","Background: Conducting surveys to assess the effect of humanitarian assistance in complex emergencies is particularly difficult due to restricted access and insecurity. Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) is one method that can be used in such a setting. Objectives: This investigation evaluated the primary health and water/sanitation services of a non-governmental organization (NGO), Medair, in conflict-affected West Darfur, Sudan, to examine the feasibility of LQAS in assessing humanitarian aid in a complex emergency. Methods: Respondents were chosen using a stratified, three-stage probability sampling method. The catchment area was divided into seven supervisory areas (SAs); 19 individuals were identified from each SA. Respondents were women between 15-49 years who had a live birth within the last two years. A questionnaire primarily based on UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 4 was developed for the assessment. Results: 82% of pregnant women had at least two antenatal care visits, but 46% received clean delivery kits. There was low coverage of the polio vaccine (29%) among children 12-23 months. Only 29% of children with fever received proper treatment for malaria, and 29% of children with diarrhea received increased fluid intake. of households surveyed, 78% had access to an improved water source. Only 19% of households had hand-washing facilities. Conclusion: LQAS is a rapid and statistically valid assessment method yielding data representative of a population. It can be applied in complex humanitarian emergencies. The results of this survey showed that the provision of primary health care in West Darfur has room for improvement. LQAS helped Medair manage their resources to improve low-performing aspects of their programs in low-performing SAs. LQAS has multiple advantages over the more widely used cluster sampling method. LQAS requires fewer samples and less time on the ground in each community to conduct surveys, a crucial factor as it decreases the risk to surveyors in insecure settings. Periodic LQAS surveys over defined time intervals are a practical management tool for NGOs to compare the performance of programs by multiple indicators and by SAs. LQAS is a useful tool to help NGOs understand how best to allocate their limited resources to meet performance targets.",2012,NA,Academic Emergency Medicine,19,NA,S305-S306,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2012.01332.x,9279,Pham 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; Sarah Meteke (2017-12-08 07:06:59)(Select): evaluating different sampling methods in conflict zone;,Sudan,0,0

Human deaths can be prevented by prompt administering of rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin following the exposure. An assessment of community knowledge, awareness and practices on rabies is important during outbreak to understand their preparedness and target educational messages and response activities by the rapid response team., METHODS: A rabies outbreak has occurred in Rangjung town, eastern Bhutan on 4 October 2016. A rapid response team was activated to investigate outbreak and to establish a control program. A community-based questionnaire survey was conducted from 20 to 21 October 2016 to assess the community knowledge of rabies to guide outbreak preparedness and also target educational messages and response activities by the RRT., RESULTS: A total of 67 respondents were interviewed, of which 61% were female and 39% male. All the respondents have heard of rabies (100%), have knowledge on source of rabies (dog) and its mode of transmission in animals and humans. Most (61%) respondents were aware and also indicated that they would wash the animal bite wound with soap and water and seek medical care on the same day of exposure (100%). Majority (94%) of the respondents have indicated that they would report to the government agencies if they see any suspected rabid dogs in the community and suggested various control measures for dog population management and rabies in Rangjung including neutering procedure and mass dog vaccination. Although only few (10%) of the respondents households owned dogs and cats, but 50% of them have indicated that their dogs were allowed to roam outside the home premises posing risk of contracting rabies through rabid dog bites., CONCLUSIONS: Although this study indicates a high level of knowledge and awareness on rabies among the community, there exists some knowledge gaps about rabies and therefore, an awareness education should be focused on the source of rabies and rabies virus transmission route to reduce public concern on nonexposure events thereby reducing the cost on unnecessary postexposure treatment.",2017,NA,BMC infectious diseases,17,1,281,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2393-x,14456,Tenzin 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong topic;,Re-screen,0,0

In addition, people are affected by armed conflicts both within Pakistan's borders and in Afghanistan, such as the decade-long conflict in the Northern provinces along the border. Consequently, a large number of refugees and internally displaced people, mostly women and children, are in shelters in internally displaced population camps. These camps lack sufficient supply and storage of daily ration, sanitation, health and educational facilities. Inhuman living conditions add an enormous burden to the level of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression of these internally displaced people. While women are extremely vulnerable to these mental health problems, their children are equally exposed and suffer with mental stresses, as mothers do not have the capacity to supervise and protect their children from the potential physical, psychological and sexual abuse prevalent in marginalised living conditions and an environment of easy exposure to social hazards and the toxic mentality of men. This conceptually based paper addresses some of the challenges and risks identified and faced by children of the camps for displaced persons in Pakistan. The authors propose a psycho-social framework based on public health interventions to decrease the risk of abuse and trauma, to protect these vulnerable children, and to maximise the strength and resilience of the family unit.

P.; Zeleke, L.; Emukule, H.; Khay, H.; Parker, J.; Peprah, D.","Objective To further the understanding of sanitation and hygiene in long-term camp populations. Methods Data were collected by structured observation of handwashing (126 households), a questionnaire on sanitation, hygiene and household characteristics (1089 households) and discussions with mothers. Random walk algorithms were used to select households for observation and survey. Respondents for qualitative methods were a convenience sample. Results Across all key handwash occasions [excluding events with no handwash (n=275)], soap was used for 30% of handwashes. After latrine use, both hands were washed with soap on 20% of occasions observed. Availability of soap in households differed across sites and mirrored the extent to which it was distributed free of charge. Qualitative data suggested lack of free soap as a barrier to 'safe' handwashing. Laundry was the priority for soap. In Ethiopia and Kenya, open defecation was practised by a significant minority and was more prevalent amongst households of rural origin. In Ethiopia, open defecation was significantly more prevalent amongst women. Conclusions Despite continuing hygiene education, rates of 'safe' handwashing are sub-optimal. Soap scarcity in some households and the prioritisation of laundry are barriers to safe practice.

Culture method which takes 24-48 h to get the feedback and requires highly skilled laboratory staff plus other complex resources is the standard test. This study evaluated the new cholera rapid detection method that relies on Crystal VC dipsticks after enrichment with alkaline peptone water (APW) against the culture method for monitoring the progress of cholera outbreaks in rural setting. Methods: We conducted the study between March and June 2015. Fresh stool samples and rectal swabs were incubated in 1% APW for 6 h at room temperature before testing with RDT following the manufacturer's instruction. The same stool sample was cultured to isolate V. cholerae in the standard manner. We also reviewed patient registers to epidemiologically describe the cholera epidemic. Results: We tested stool from 102 consenting suspected cholera patients reporting during daytime at Bwera Hospital (n=69), Kilembe Mines Hospital (n=4) and Kinyabwama Health Centre (n=29). Ninety one (91) samples were positive and nine samples were negative according to both methods. One (1) sample was positive only by dipstick and one sample was positive only by culture (sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 90%, Positive Predictive Value of 99% and Negative Predictive Value of 90%). Overall, 146 suspected cholera cases and two deaths, (case fatality rate of 1.36%) were recorded during the study period. Among the cases aged 1-9 years, 63% (50/79) were males while in those aged 20-49 years, 76% (34/45) were females. Conclusions: Our findings showed that the modified dipstick test after enrichment with 1% APW had high level of accuracy in detection of V. cholerae and is quick, affordable alternative cholera outbreak monitoring tool in resource constrained settings. However, culture method should remain for cholera epidemic confirmation, for monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity and for production of pure isolates for molecular characterization.

B.; Muhindo, B.; Breiman, R.; Eidex, R.","Refugee camps are vulnerable to cholera outbreaks due to limited resources, poor sanitation and overcrowding. Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya has experienced recurrent cholera outbreaks. We report on findings from a cholera outbreak from September-December, 2009 with 224 cases and four deaths. We conducted a case control study in December 2009. Cases were identified by reviewing the hospital registry for patients meeting the WHO case definition for cholera. Two controls were selected per case; one was matched to the case based on area of the camp (the camp is separated into four areas) and age group (<5, 5-14, 15-24, and >25 years), and the second was an unmatched control selected by three-stage sampling method. A questionnaire focusing on potential risk factors was administered to cases and controls. A total of 93 cases, 93 matched and 126 unmatched controls, were enrolled into the study. In a multivariate model including cases and matched controls, washing hands with soap was protective against cholera (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =0.25; p<0.01) while presence of dirty water storage containers was a risk factor (AOR=4.4; p=0.03). In the multivariate model including cases and unmatched controls, using a latrine consistently was protective against cholera (AOR=0.13; p<0.01), whereas children not using a latrine (AOR=2.8; p=0.02) and living in Area A (AOR=10.23; p<0.0001) were risk factors.

Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of TF outbreaks in 2011 in Kikwit, DRC using microbiological analysis of water sources and a structured interview questionnaire. Results: There were a total of 1430 reported TF cases. The outbreak's epidemic curve shows earliest and highest peak attack rates (AR) in three military camps located in Kikwit (Ebeya 3.2%; Ngubu 3.0%; and Nsinga 2.2%) compared to an average peak AR of 0.6% in other affected areas. A total 320 cases from the military camps and the high burden health areas were interviewed. Typhoid cases in the military camps shared a latrine with more than one family (P<0.02). All tap water sources in both the military camps and general population were found to be highly contaminated with faecal coliforms. Conclusion: The role of military camps in Kikwit as early hotspots of TF transmission was likely associated with lower sanitary and hygiene conditions. The proximity of camps to the general population might have been responsible for disseminating TF to the general population. Mapping of cases during an outbreak could be crucial to identify hot spots for transmission and institute corrective measures.Copyright © Engy Ali et al.",2017,/,Pan African Medical Journal,28,"(Hunter) School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom",179,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2017.28.179.10208,620498818,Ali 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong patient population;,Search2018,1,0

As part of a planned pre- and postevaluation of these upgrades and extensions, we conducted a baseline household survey to estimate the impact of the rehabilitation of Lusaka's central drainage on incidence of disease, flooding frequency and duration, household travel time, and employment and expenditure patterns. From January-May 2016, we surveyed 3,142 randomly selected households within 250 meters of the drain. We found that 19% of households had at least one member who had diarrhea (at least three loose stools in a 24 hour period) or respiratory illness [fever and (cough and/or sore throat)] in the 7 day period prior to interview. The incidence of diarrheal illness was 3.0% overall and 7.8% for children <5 years; 6% of individuals with diarrhea reported blood in their stool. Median duration of illness was 3 days (range 1-32). Respiratory illness incidence was 2.4% overall and 7.0% for children <5 years. Median duration of illness was 4 days (range 1-40). Of 1,064 children for whom an under-5 vaccination card was available, 68% were fully vaccinated against rotavirus (had received two doses); 6% had received one dose, and 24% had not been vaccinated. Sixty percent of households reported flooding in the month prior to the interview. Mean duration of flooding was 3.3 days, median 2 days (range 1-31). Median reported travel times were significantly longer during periods with flooding compared to periods without, for both school (15 minutes vs. 25 minutes, p<0.0001) and work (30 minutes vs. 40 minutes, p<0.0001). The majority of households (90%) had at least one adult member employed. Surveyed households spent a mean of $157 per month on food items. This is similar to the mean of $161 per month for non-food items (which includes rent). Relatively large proportions of household expenditures on food are indicative of low-income households.

#4464,"Progress toward poliomyelitis eradication -- Nigeria, January 2008-July 2009",NA,"Although wild poliovirus (WPV) cases in Nigeria decreased from 1,129 in 2006 to 285 in 2007, Nigeria had the world's highest polio burden in 2008, with 798 (48%) of 1,651 WPV cases reported globally, including 721 (74%) of 976 WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases. This report provides an update on progress toward polio eradication in Nigeria during 2008--2009 and activities planned to interrupt transmission. During 2008--2009, Nigeria was the source for WPV1 transmission to 11 countries and WPV type 3 (WPV3) transmission to four countries. In addition, transmission of circulating type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) has been ongoing since 2005. WPV1 cases decreased 87%, from 574 during January--July 2008 to 73 for the same period in 2009. However, WPV3 cases rose approximately six-fold, from 51 during January--July 2008 to 303 during the same period in 2009, partly because of the increased emphasis on controlling WPV1. The decline in the proportion of children who have never received oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the highest- incidence northern states, from 31% in 2006 to 11% in the first half of 2009 indicates progress toward eradication. During 2008--2009, activities to accelerate polio eradication included use of mobile teams to vaccinate children not at home during supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), and efforts to increase political oversight and the engagement of community leaders.

#3904,"A large outbreak of hepatitis E among a displaced population in Darfur, Sudan, 2004: The role of water treatment methods","Guthmann, J. P.; Klovstad, H.; Boccia, D.; Hamid, N.; Pinoges, L.; Nizou, J. Y.; Tatay, M.; Diaz, F.; Moren, A.; Grais, R. F.; Ciglenecki, I.; Nicand, E.; Guerin, P. J.","Background. The conflict in Darfur, Sudan, was responsible for the displacement of 1.8 million civilians. We investigated a large outbreak of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Mornay camp (78,800 inhabitants) in western Darfur. Methods. To describe the outbreak, we used clinical and demographic information from cases recorded at the camp between 26 July and 31 December 2004. We conducted a case-cohort study and a retrospective cohort study to identify risk factors for clinical and asymptomatic hepatitis E, respectively. We collected stool and serum samples from animals and performed a bacteriological analysis of water samples. Human samples were tested for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody to HEV (for serum samples) and for amplification of the HEV genome (for serum and stool samples). Results. In 6 months, 2621 hepatitis E cases were recorded (attack rate, 3.3%), with a case-fatality rate of 1.7% (45 deaths, 19 of which involved were pregnant women). Risk factors for clinical HEV infection included age of 15-45 years (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-4.46) and drinking chlorinated surface water (odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-5.08). Both factors were also suggestive of increased risk for asymptomatic HEV infection, although this was not found to be statistically significant. HEV RNA was positively identified in serum samples obtained from 2 donkeys. No bacteria were identified from any sample of chlorinated water tested. Conclusions. Current recommendations to ensure a safe water supply may have been insufficient to inactivate HEV and control this epidemic.

#6610,Maintaining low mortality rates in displaced populations: MSF experience in Minkaman,"Rull, M.; Masson, S.; Peyraud, N.; Simonelli, M.; Ventura, A.; Dorion, C.; Luquero, F.; Ciglenecki, I.","INTRODUCTION Population displacement in camp settings can lead to high mortality, especially early following displacement. Addressing the main needs of the population ('10 priorities') can prevent this. Since December 2013, armed conflict led to a massive displacement of the population in South Sudan. As of April 2014, approximately 80 000 internally displaced persons were living around Minkaman in Awarial County of Lakes State, where MSF was one of the main humanitarian actors. METHODS Provision of safe drinking water was assured immediately by a water treatment station with water trucking distribution system and bucket chlorination. By January 2014, 4 primary health care clinics, a hospital, nutritional program and a network of oral rehydration points to address the high number of diarrheal cases in the camp were functional. In addition, mass vaccination campaigns were organized to prevent outbreaks of main epidemic prone diseases: measles, cholera and meningitis. A network of community health workers was ensuring community surveillance and spread of health promotion messages. Food and non-food items were provided by other actors. A cross-sectional mortality survey was carried in May 2014, using two-stage cluster design. RESULTS From January 1st to October 15th 2014, 52 047 people attended the outpatient department and 2032 patients were admitted in the hospital. 731 children were admitted in the nutritional programs (161 of them requiring admission in intensive care) and 2778 women received antenatal care. In addition 480 m3 of treated water were delivered daily ensuring the minimum of 5 l of drinking water/person/day. The crude mortality rate (CMR) between end of December 2013 and May 2014 was estimated at 0.59/10 000/day [95%CI: 0.43-0.82], and the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) at 0.50 deaths/10 000/day [95%CI: 0.43-0.82]; 45% of those deaths were due to trauma and occurred before arrival to the camp. No outbreak of vaccine preventable disease occurred in Minkamman, although there was widespread measles outbreak ongoing in the region, and sporadic cases were reported in the camp. Cholera outbreaks were reported throughout South Sudan from May on, with no cases in Minkamman. CONCLUSION CMR remained below national average at all times. While several outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases ravaged across South Sudan, Minkaman was spared.

#2932,Solar disinfection of drinking water protects against cholera in children under 6 years of age,"Conroy, R. M.; Meegan, M. E.; Joyce, T.; McGuigan, K.; Barnes, J.","Background and Aims - We have previously reported a reduction in risk of diarrhoeal disease in children who used solar disinfected drinking water. A cholera epidemic, occurring in an area of Kenya in which a controlled trial of solar disinfection and diarrhoeal disease in children aged under 6 had recently finished, offered an opportunity to examine the protection offered by solar disinfection against cholera. Methods - In the original trial, all children aged under 6 in a Maasai community were randomised by household: in the solar disinfection arm, children drank water disinfected by leaving it on the roof in a clear plastic bottle, while controls drank water kept indoors. We revisited all households which had participated in the original trial. Results - There were 131 households in the trial area, of which 67 had been randomised to solar disinfection (a further 19 households had migrated as a result of severe drought). There was no significant difference in the risk of cholera in adults or in older children in households randomised to solar disinfection; however, there were only three cases of cholera in the 155 children aged under 6 years drinking solar disinfected water compared with 20 of 144 controls. Conclusions - Results confirm the usefulness of solar disinfection in reducing risk of water borne disease in children. Point of consumption solar disinfection can be done with minimal resources, which are readily available, and may be an important first line response to cholera outbreaks.

M.","Background: More than 3.5 million children aged less than 5 years die from diarrhoea and acute lower respiratory-tract infection every year. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of handwashing promotion with soap on the incidence of acute respiratory infection, impetigo, and diarrhoea. Methods: In adjoining squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan, we randomly assigned 25 neighbourhoods to handwashing promotion; 11 neighbourhoods (306 households) were randomised as controls. In neighbourhoods with handwashing promotion, 300 households each were assigned to antibacterial soap containing 1.2% triclocarban and to plain soap. Fieldworkers visited households weekly for 1 year to encourage handwashing by residents in soap households and to record symptoms in all households. Primary study outcomes were diarrhoea, impetigo, and acute respiratory-tract infections (ie, the number of new episodes of illness per person-weeks at risk). Pneumonia was defined according to the WHO clinical case definition. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: Children younger than 5 years in households that received plain soap and handwashing promotion had a 50% lower incidence of pneumonia than controls (95% CI (-65% to -34%). Also compared with controls, children younger than 15 years in households with plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhoea (-65% to -41%) and a 34% lower incidence of impetigo (-52% to -16%). Incidence of disease did not differ significantly between households given plain soap compared with those given antibacterial soap.

Due to the high level of dependency of refugees, agencies need to carry out these assessments. Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) is a method commonly used in development settings to assess populations living in a project catchment area to identify their greatest needs. LQAS could be well suited to serve the needs of refugee populations, but it has rarely been used in humanitarian settings. We adapted and implemented an LQAS survey design in Batil refugee camp, South Sudan in May 2013 to measure the added value of using it for sub-camp level assessment., METHODS: Using pre-existing divisions within the camp, we divided the Batil catchment area into six contiguous segments, called 'supervision areas' (SA). Six teams of two data collectors randomly selected 19 respondents in each SA, who they interviewed to collect information on water, sanitation, hygiene, and diarrhoea prevalence. These findings were aggregated into a stratified random sample of 114 respondents, and the results were analysed to produce a coverage estimate with 95% confidence interval for the camp and to prioritize SAs within the camp., RESULTS: The survey provided coverage estimates on WASH indicators as well as evidence that areas of the camp closer to the main road, to clinics and to the market were better served than areas at the periphery of the camp. This assumption did not hold for all services, however, as sanitation services were uniformly high regardless of location. While it was necessary to adapt the standard LQAS protocol used in low-resource communities, the LQAS model proved to be feasible in a refugee camp setting, and program managers found the results useful at both the catchment area and SA level., CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the few adaptations of LQAS for a camp setting, shows that it is a feasible method for regular monitoring, with the added value of enabling camp managers to identify and advocate for the least served areas within the camp.

#7125,Leaving a legacy after a three year global links project at a rural Kenyan hospital,Tricks R.; Bean A.; Slater J.,"Introduction The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's Global Links (GL) Programme, has worked in collaboration with the Kenyan Paediatric Association since 2012. One alliance involved Paediatric trainees from one deanery supporting a hospital in rural Kenya, aiming to implement training and quality improvement projects, providing sustainable improvements and benefit to the hospital and workforce. This link ended in July 2016. Methods Between 2013 and 2016, 6 trainees undertook six 6 month placements. Improvements in Neonatal care included; hand hygiene, thermal care, and introduction of CPAP (continuous positive pressure ventilation). In Paediatrics, projects included; introducing regular ETAT (Emergency Treatment, Assessment and Triage) training, evaluation of inpatient nutritional status and improving standards of assessment and documentation according to the Kenyan Basic Paediatric Protocols alongside developing a Paediatric Handbook for the hospital. Results In Neonates, the annual mortality rate fell from 21.6% (2014) to 6.9% (2016 to date). Admissions increased from a mean of 13 to 17 per month. Total mortalities reduced from a mean of 2.75 to 1.2 per month. Hand hygiene compliance improved from 66% (2013) to 93.7% (2015). However in the four months since leaving, the monthly mortality rate was 15%, mean admission numbers-16 and mean total monthly deaths-2. In Paediatrics, admission weight documentation increased from 76% (2014) to 94% (2016). Malnutrition status documentation improved from 0% (2014) to 55% (2016). Conclusions A GL Volunteer presence appears to be associated with significant improvements in the quality of care at this hospital. The unique link with a single deanery enabled close communication between volunteers, allowing each to develop and improve on their predecessors projects. Recent data shows these results are challenging to sustain in a low resource environment with a high staff turnover without volunteer support.

G.; Tchatchioka, M.; Lungu, G.","Of all populations affected by cholera, refugees are at particular risk of infection due to overcrowding and poor sanitation. Between 15 March and 17 May 1988, 951 cases of cholera were registered at the cholera treatment centre in a Mozambican refugee camp in Malawi. The epidemic duration was 65 days. Vibrio cholerae biotype E1 Tor serotype Inaba was isolated. To identify high-risk groups and potential risk of acquiring the disease, an epidemiologic investigation was conducted. The attack rate of recorded cases was 2.6% with a range from 0.9 to 5.1% for different sections of the camp. The case fatality rate was 3.3% and decreased from week 1 to week 6. The epidemic started in the section near the market place and radiated out. A matched-pair case-control study of food and water consumption was performed early in the outbreak. It showed that cases were more likely to use shallow wells (surface wells) instead of boreholes compared to controls (OR = 4.5, CI = 1.0-20.8, P = 0.04) and that cases were more likely to have had contact with the market than controls (OR = 3.5, CI = 0.7-16.8, P = 0.09).

We conducted an investigation to identify the mode of transmission to guide control measures., METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of acute watery diarrhoea from 1 February 2015 onwards in a Kasese resident. A confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, serotype Inaba cultured from a stool sample. We reviewed medical records to find cases. We conducted a case-control study to compare exposures among confirmed case-persons and asymptomatic controls, matched by village and age-group. We conducted environmental assessments. We tested water samples from the most affected area for total coliforms using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method., RESULTS: We identified 183 suspected cases including 61 confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae 01; serotype Inaba, with onset between February and July 2015. 2 case-persons died of cholera. The outbreak occurred in 80 villages and affected all age groups; the highest attack rate occurred in the 5-14 year age group (4.1/10,000). The outbreak started in Bwera Sub-County bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo and spread eastward through sustained community transmission. The first case-persons were involved in cross-border trading. The case-control study, which involved 49 confirmed cases and 201 controls, showed that 94% (46/49) of case-persons compared with 79% (160/201) of control-persons drank water without boiling or treatment (ORM-H=4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-18). Water collected from the two main sources, i.e., public pipes (consumed by 39% of case-persons and 38% of control-persons) or streams (consumed by 29% of case-persons and 24% control-persons) had high coliform counts, a marker of faecal contamination. Environmental assessment revealed evidence of open defecation along the streams. No food items were significantly associated with illness., CONCLUSIONS: This prolonged, community-wide cholera outbreak was associated with drinking water contaminated by faecal matter and cross-border trading. We recommended rigorous disposal of patients' faeces, chlorination of piped water, and boiling or treatment of drinking water.

#7232,"Sanitation practices and perceptions in Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya: Comparing the status quo with a novel service-based approach",Nyoka R.; Foote A.D.; Woods E.; Lokey H.; O'Reilly C.E.; Magumba F.; Okello P.; Mintz E.D.; Marano N.; Morris J.F.,"Globally, an estimated 2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation. Unimproved sanitation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in protracted refugee situations where sanitation is based on pit latrine use. Once the pit is full, waste remains in the pit, necessitating the construction of a new latrine, straining available land and funding resources. A viable, sustainable solution is needed. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to design, implement, and pilot a novel sanitation system in Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya. An initial round of 12 pre-implementation focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with Dinka and Somali residents to understand sanitation practices, perceptions, and needs. FGDs and a supplementary pre-implementation survey informed the development of an innovative sanitation management system that incorporated the provision of urine and liquid-diverting toilets, which separate urine and fecal waste, and a servicebased sanitation system that included weekly waste collection. The new system was implemented on a pilot scale for 6 weeks. During the implementation, bi-weekly surveys were administered in each study household to monitor user perceptions and challenges. At the end of the pilot, the sanitation system was assessed using a second round of four postimplementation FGDs. Those who piloted the new sanitation system reported high levels of user satisfaction. Reported benefits included odor reduction, insect/pest reduction, the sitting design, the appropriateness for special populations, and waste collection. However, urine and liquid diversion presented a challenge for users who perform anal washing and for women who had experienced female genital mutilation. Refugee populations are often culturally and ethnically diverse. Using residents input to inform the development of sanitation solutions can increase user acceptability and provide opportunities to improve sanitation system designs based on specific needs.",2017,/,PLoS ONE,12,7,e0180864,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180864,617293297,Nyoka 2017,NA,Search2018,1,1

J.; Gandubert, C.; Morin, F.","Upper Nile Province is one of the four main endemic areas for Guinea worm disease in the Sudan. In December 1994, a survey was conducted in the village of Ayod where the disease is endemic, to investigate morbidity and local knowledge of transmission and prevention. Interviews were conducted in households selected by standard cluster sampling procedures and of the 759 people examined, 156 (20.6%) had Guinea worm lesions. Adjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the relative risk for people with different personal or household characteristics in a multivariate analysis. After controlling for the possible confounding effects of other study variables, having a filter in the household, gender, and lack of knowledge about transmission and about prevention, were not associated with lesions. Only two variables were significantly associated with Guinea worm disease: getting water from a source other than a well increased the risk by a factor of 2.3, and being aged 5 years or more increased the risk by a factor of 31.1. This study demonstrates the clear association between the source of water for drinking and Guinea worm disease found elsewhere. We suggest the provision of reliable sources of pure drinking water and health education are the most suitable long-term preventive measures. The Sudan now represents the greatest challenge to the goal of global eradication of Guinea worm disease, following the reduction in cases in Nigeria.

B.; Weinberg, M.; Feikin, D. R.","An outbreak of watery diarrhea struck within the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya in April 2005; 418 people were treated, and 4 persons died. Vibrio cholerae Ol was isolated from 33 patients. In June 2005, we conducted a retrospective matched case-control study to define risk factors associated with cholera among camp residents and identify interventions that could prevent further cases and future outbreaks. We identified cases of cholera through medical records at the main health facility in the camp and matched controls (without watery diarrhea since November 2004) to the cases by age category (< 2,2-4,5-14, and > 14 years) and location of residence within the camp. Cases were defined as any person of any age with profuse, effortless watery diarrhea (three or more stools in 24 hours). A multivariate model showed that storing drinking water at home in sealed or covered containers was protective against cholera (matched odds ratio [MOR] = 0.49 [0.25,0.96]), whereas ""sharing a latrine with at least three households"" (MOR = 2.17 [1.01,4.68]) and arriving at the Kakuma camp on or after November 2004 (MOR = 4.66 [1.35,16.05]) were risk factors. Improving sanitation and promoting methods to ensure safe drinking water are likely to be effective measures in moderating future cholera outbreaks in this setting.

A wealth of evidence supports the positive impact of hand washing promotion for prevention of both diarrhea and ARI. While socially and emotionally driven factors are proven motivators to hand washing in nonemergency situations, little is known about how to improve hand washing behavior in emergency settings. To identify motivators and barriers to hand washing, we conducted a qualitative investigation from June to August 2015 in a camp for internally displaced persons with a population of 6360 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We held key informant interviews with 9 NGO and camp officials, in-depth interviews with 18 mothers of children <5 years, and 4 group discussions with camp residents. Hand washing using either soap or ash was observed to occur after 10% of latrine use events. Messages to promote hand washing were focused on disease transmission and prevention and disseminated regularly since the camp opened. Hardware for communal and home hand washing stations was reported to be old, unavailable or culturally unacceptable. Residents who engaged in day labor outside the camp had limited exposure to hygiene messages and hand washing technology. Mother-respondents identified health and illness prevention as the primary reason for hand washing. Further probing elicited emotionally and socially related motivators, including the desire to maintain a clean appearance and fresh smelling hands, which respondents stated evoked pride and status in the community. Respondents also alluded to social pressure to follow hygiene practices recommended in the camp. A substantial deficit in hand washing practices with soap highlights the need to improve hand washing promotion strategies. The focus on health-related motivators and failure to use emotive and social drivers for hand washing may have led to missed opportunities of communication approaches shown to be effective in other settings.

M.; Brdjanovic, D.","Proper provision of sanitation in emergencies is considered a life-saving intervention. Without access to sanitation, refugees at emergency camps are at a high risk of contracting diseases. Even the most knowledgeable relief agencies have experienced difficulties providing sanitation alternatives in such challenging scenarios. This study developed a computer-based decision support system (DSS) to plan a sanitation response in emergencies. The sanitation alternatives suggested by the DSS are based on a sanitation chain concept that considers different steps in the faecal sludge management, from the toilet or latrine to the safe disposal of faecal matters. The DSS first screens individual sanitation technologies using the user's given input. Remaining sanitation options are then built into a feasible sanitation chain. Subsequently, each technology in the chain is evaluated on a scoring system. Different sanitation chains can later be ranked based on the total evaluation scores. The DSS addresses several deficiencies encountered in the provision of sanitation in emergencies including: the application of standard practices and intuition, the omission of site specific conditions, the limited knowledge exhibited by emergency planners, and the provision of sanitation focused exclusively on the collection step (i.e., just the provision of toilets)., Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015,NA,Science of the Total Environment,512-513,NA,645-658,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.01.051,10235,Zakaria 2015,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; Sarah Meteke (2017-12-07 03:54:05)(Select): no conflict, no specific country;",NA,1,0

This demonstrates that average levels of water and sanitation provision are acceptable at camp level but many refugee operations are suffering from gaps that cross-cut these sectors; e.g. typically poor sanitation provision is corresponding with low per capita availability of water. These findings were confirmed at household level with two household surveys undertaken in African refugee camps; households reporting a case of diarrhoea within the previous 24 hours collect on average 26% less water than those not reporting any cases. In addition, typically higher levels of morbidity of one infectious agent are also reflected across other infectious agents; this is reinforced by comparing the relationship between morbidity and nutrition status from selected camps. The importance that hygiene, environmental conditions and local settings have on health (both of refugees and also local communities) is underlined.

J.","The flight of 500 000-800 000 Rwandan refugees into the North Kivu region of Zaire in July, 1994, overwhelmed the world's response capacity. During the first month after the influx, almost 50 000 refugees died, an average crude mortality rate of 20-35 per 10 000 per day. This death rate was associated with explosive epidemics of diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae 01 and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. 3-4 weeks after the influx of refugees, acute malnutrition rates among children under 5 years old ranged between 18 and 23%. Children with a recent history of dysentery and those in households headed by women were at higher risk of malnutrition. A well-coordinated relief programme, based on rapidly acquired health data and effective interventions, was associated with a steep decline in death rates to 5 to 8 per 10 000 per day by the second month of the crisis. The prevention of high mortality due to diarrhoeal disease epidemics in displaced populations relies primarily on the prompt provision of adequate quantities of disinfected water, basic sanitation, community outreach, and effective case management of ill patients.

W.; Muhindo, B. Z.; Breiman, R. F.; Eidex, R. B.","Introduction: Cholera remains a major public health problem that causes substantial morbidity and mortality in displaced populations due to inadequate or unprotected water supplies, poor sanitation and hygiene, overcrowding, and limited resources. A cholera outbreak with 224 cases and four deaths occurred in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya from September to December 2009. Methodology: We conducted a case-control study to characterize the epidemiology of the outbreak. Cases were identified by reviewing the hospital registry for patients meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for cholera. For each case a matched control was selected. A questionnaire focusing on potential risk factors was administered to cases and controls. Results: From 18 September to 15 December 2009, a total of 224 cases were identified and were hospitalised at Kakuma IRC hospital. Three refugees and one Kenyan national died of cholera. V. cholerae O1, serotype Inaba was isolated in 44 (42%) out of 104 stool specimens collected. A total of 93 cases and 93 matched controls were enrolled in the study. In a multivariate model, washing hands with soap was protective against cholera (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =0.25[0.09-0.71]; p<0.01), while presence of dirty water storage containers was a risk factor (AOR=4.39[1.12-17.14]; p=0.03). Conclusion: Provision of soap, along with education on hand hygiene and cleaning water storage containers, may be an affordable intervention to prevent cholera. © 2012 Mahamud et al.",2012,NA,Journal of Infection in Developing Countries,6,3,234-241,NA,NA,8745,Mahamud 2012,NA,NA,1,1

Early in the epidemic, although the health ministry mandated that the bodies of persons dying of cholera be disinfected, outbreaks occurred in several villages following funerals in the region of Biombo. To determine the influence of disinfection and funeral activities on cholera transmission, we analysed surveillance data and conducted a case-control study following a funeral. The attack rate during the week following funerals was higher in villages where bodies were not disinfected (risk ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-3.8). Cholera was strongly associated with eating at a funeral with a non-disinfected corpse (odds ratio [OR] = 14.5, 95% CI 0.9-786) and with touching (i.e., transporting, washing) the body (OR = 36.2, 95% CI 2.6-1769).

#6085,The impact of social action funds on child health in a conflict affected country: Evidence from Angola,"Djimeu, Eric W.","Abstract: Although recent evidence shows significant and long-lasting detrimental effects of armed conflict on child health, there is lack of studies rigorously assessing the effectiveness of different social and economic development interventions aiming to mitigate the impact of armed conflict on child health. In order to fill this knowledge gap, this study assesses the impact of health projects and water, sanitation, and waste management interventions financed by the Angola Social Action Fund (ASAF) from 1994 to 2001 on child health. I use data from InquÃ©rito aos Agregados Familiares sobre Despesas e Receitas 2000/2001(IDR 2001), a household survey on expenditures and incomes conducted between February 2000 and February 2001 in Angola. IDR 2001 uses a stratified sampling design in which 12 households were surveyed in a random fashion in each aldeia (village) in rural areas and bairro (neighborhood) in urban areas. Using propensity score matching, a fixed effects model, and propensity-based weighted regression, I find that ASAF leads to a statistically significant increase of the height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) by 0.335 standard deviations of children less than 5 years. This finding is robust to different implementations of the propensity score model specification and when conducting the sensitivity analysis of hidden bias. The main result that emerges from an analysis of heterogeneous effects shows that ASAF has no impact on children living in war displaced households. Despite many challenges faced by conflict affected countries, social funds which are one the key instruments of the World Bank used to promote development at the local level can be used to mitigate the impact of armed conflict on child health. For children living in war displaced households, specific interventions should be designed to mitigate the impact of armed conflict.",2014,NA,Social Science & Medicine,106,NA,35-42,104044974.

In the context of a civil war, a cholera outbreak was declared in different parts of the country October 6th, 2016. This paper describes the ACF outbreak response in Hodeidah city from October 28th, 2016 to February 28th, 2017 in order to add knowledge to this large outbreak., Methods: The ACF outbreak response in Hodeidah city included a case management component and prevention measures in the community. In partnership with the Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen (MoPHP), the case management component included a Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) implemented in the Al Thoraw hospital, 11 Oral Rehydration Therapy Corners (ORTCs) and an active case finding system. In partnership with other stakeholders, prevention measures in the community, including access to safe water and hygiene promotion, were implemented in the most affected communities of the city., Results: From October 28th, 2016 until February 28th, 2017, ACF provided care to 8,270 Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) cases, of which 5,210 (63%) were suspected cholera cases, in the CTC and the 11 ORTCs implemented in Hodeidah city. The attack rate was higher among people living in Al Hali district, with a peak in November 2016. At the CTC, 8% of children under 5 years-old also presented with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). The Case-Fatality Rate (CFR) was low (0.07%) but 15% of admitted cases defaulted for cultural and security reasons. Environmental management lacked the information to appropriately target affected areas. Financial resources did not allow complete coverage of the city., Conclusion: Response to the first wave of a large cholera outbreak in Hodeidah city was successful in maintaining a CFR <1% in the CTC.

S.","SummaryBackground Hymenolepis nana is among the most common intestinal parasitic infections causing a public health threat in poor communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence of H. nana infections and associated risk factors among preschool children of displacement communities in Khartoum state, Sudan. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in May 2013 in displacement camps, Khartoum state, Sudan. A simple random sample of preschool children from the displacement camps, aged between 1 and 5 years, were included. Information was collected by presenting a questionnaire and taking 500 fresh stool specimens which were examined microscopically for the presence of eggs, using direct saline and formal-ether concentration techniques. Results The prevalence of H. nana was determined to be 32.6% (163/500), 95% CI (28.5%-36.9%). Infections of H. nana were more prevalent among males than females, and this association was statistically significant (P < 0.001, OR = 2.125, 95% CI = 1.452-3.108). H. nana infections were significantly prevalent among the older age group (2.6-5.0 years) (P < 0.001, OR = 2.909, 95% CI = 1.914-4.420). Approximately 76.7% of infected preschool children had diarrhea and it was significantly associated with H. nana infection (P < 0.001, OR = 9.45, 95% CI = 6.10-14.64). None of the preschool children had access to a clean water supply. No significant association was found between use of latrines and infections of H. nana (P = 0.56, OR = 0.880, 95% CI = 0.73-1.763). Conclusions There was a high prevalence rate of H. nana infection among preschool children of displacement camps in Khartoum state, Sudan. Being male, aged between 2.6 and 5.0 years, and having diarrhea were identified as important risk factors for H. nana infection.

In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a framework for decision making to help prioritize vaccinations in acute humanitarian emergencies. This article describes MSF's experience of applying this framework in addition to addressing key population needs in a displacement setting in Minkaman, South Sudan., Case description: Military clashes broke out in South Sudan in December 2013. By May 2014, Minkaman, a village in the Lakes State, hosted some 85,000 displaced people. MSF arrived in Minkaman on 28 December 2013 and immediately provided interventions to address the key humanitarian needs (health care, access to drinking water, measles vaccination). The WHO framework was used to identify priority vaccines: those preventing outbreaks (measles, polio, oral cholera vaccine, and vaccine against meningococcal meningitis A (MenAfrivac)) and those reducing childhood morbidity and mortality (pentavalent vaccine that combines diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B; pneumococcal vaccine; and rotavirus vaccine). By mid-March, access to primary and secondary health care was ensured, including community health activities and the provision of safe water. Mass vaccination campaigns against measles, polio, cholera, and meningitis had been organized. Vaccination campaigns against the main deadly childhood diseases, however, were not in place owing to lack of authorization by the Ministry of Health (MoH)., Conclusions: The first field use of the new WHO framework for prioritizing vaccines in acute emergencies is described. Although MSF was unable to implement the full package of priority vaccines because authorization could not be obtained from the MoH, a series of mass vaccination campaigns against key epidemic-prone diseases was successfully implemented within a complex emergency context. Together with covering the population's basic needs, this might have contributed to reducing mortality levels below the emergency threshold and to the absence of epidemics. For the WHO framework to be used to its full potential it must not only be adapted for field use but, most importantly, national decision makers should be briefed on the framework and its practical implementation.",2018,/,Conflict and health,12,101286573,11,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13031-018-0147-z,29599819,Rull 2018,NA,Search2018,1,1

Important lessons from the past must be applied today if the crisis is to be averted. Sanitation has suffered from a lack of prioritization for as long as it has remained the poor relation to water supply. The International Year of Sanitation 2008 provides an opportunity to separate the two and give sanitation the emphasis it requires. The economic argument for sanitation must be articulated and non-health incentives for improved sanitation exploited. Environmental sanitation results in a multitude of socio-economic benefits and can contribute positively to all the Millennium Development Goals. Community-led bottom-up approaches, rather than supply-led or technology-driven approaches, are most effective in increasing and sustaining access to sanitation but need to be implemented at scale. Targeted strategies for urban and school sanitation are also required.

#2389,Migration and health,"Litvinjenko, S.","In the last decades of this century we are witnesses of frequent crises in different parts of the world produced by internal disturbance and wars. These crises, together with natural disasters, poverty and hunger, follow the history of mankind often forcing huge population groups to leave their homes. The harmful health consequences are among negative effects of migrations. While stable populations have well-tried routines for maintaining health, migrations mean abandoning such support systems. The increased exposure to harmful factors contributes more to the bad health condition of the migrant population. Setting of newcomers and local people together in the same homes, reduction in food and heating resources, drug shortage as well as importation of new infectious agents, may also endanger health of the native population. These observations have also been confirmed by Yugoslav experience. Depending on the fact whether a migration is elemental or organized i.e. dependent on its place in the large scale between these two extreme endpoints, the size of risk is also dependent on the consequences and degree of their difficulty. Mass health disturbances occur during migrations of the population from war regions, migrations from areas of natural disasters, mass pilgrimage, migrations of seasonal workers and migrations of armies during wars. However, even in these difficult times and conditions, a good organization can contribute to the mitigation of harmful consequences caused by these migrations. For instance, in 1942 there was an epidemic of typhus fever in Bosnia when many refugees crossed the Drina river on the way to Serbia escaping from Ustasha terrorism. At the Serbian side there were checkpoints where the refugees could taka a bath and where their laundry and clothing were depediculated with dry air, and after a two-week quarantine they could continue to Serbian provinces without making new foci of typhus fever. The most vulnerable and numerous group of refugees is usually composed of women, children and old persons. One of the largest migrations took place over the period from 1991 to 1995, when about 1,500,000 people left the war areas of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Of that number, about 700.000 refugees came to Yugoslavia. In August 1995 during an unprecedented exile from the Kninska krajina region (Croatia) over 200,000 people left their homes. During the arrival of refugees and expelled persons health teams offered first aid to these unlucky persons at reception points: drinking water, food, emergency care and indispensable clothing. The next step in their task was to move refugees into families i.e. into collective camps and centres. As in similar situations, this migration had also its negative effects on health of the refugees. At this time, however, the situation was aggravated by international economic sanctions imposed to Yugoslavia although Yugoslavia has accepted and received more refugees than all European countries together. In 1992 a special refugees Law was promulgated in Yugoslavia. In this Law, among other things, it was stated that ""the organized reception, temporary lodging, nutrition, appropriate health care, material and other sort of help"" will be secured to refugees. The increased infant mortality rate in Yugoslavia may be ascribed to migrations. After several years of decrease it was in constant rise over the period from 1991 to 1995 (Table 1). Disturbed mental balance, loosing of ethic norms, feeling of hopelessness and despair, and underestimation of the risk of infections among refugees, contributed to the rise of promiscuity and increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, the number of registered cases of symphills in the period 1991-1995 was six times greater than in previous years. The number of gonorrhea cases was twice greater in this period than before that time. At the same time, it should be emphasized that the number of recorded cases was smaller than it w",1997,NA,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,125,08-Jul,191-196,NA,NA,8665,Litvinjenko 1997,Exclusion reason: Non English;,NA,0,0
#7335,Influence of gender and social disparities on Water Sanitation Hygiene (WASH) associated outcomes in peri-urban households of Kenya.,"Chakraborty, Poulomy","This study examines the relationship between gender, social support, psychosocial stress and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions in three communities of Kisumu, Kenya. Between 2014 and 2015, a mixed methods approach was used to collect data on household socio-demographic characteristics, decision-making capabilities, and caretaking behaviors among 800 households in Kisumu. The findings from this study indicate that household WASH conditions and behaviors are strongly influenced by the gender of the head of the household, with female-headed households showing a higher prevalence of positive WASH conditions. Women's capacity to make decisions about WASH-related behaviors and WASH conditions are influenced by social support from their families and people around them. Social support enables mothers in these communities to respond to the frequent episodes of severe childhood diarrhea. Finally, the study indicates that poor household WASH conditions act as a psychosocial stressor for women. Additional research is necessary to identify the mechanisms mediating stress levels, however women in Kisumu reported being victims of gender-based violence due to lack of adequate access to WASH facilities. Thus more attention is needed to introduce gender sensitive WASH programs, and include community social structures to create social capital, to increase negotiating capabilities of women for improving their WASH conditions, and to enable them to manage WASH based conditions better.

Data were obtained through administration of a structured KAP questionnaire. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed using STATA software. Results: A total of 671 respondents comprising 264 (39.3%) males and 407 (60.7%) females were enrolled in the study. A comparison of hand washing practices before and after institution of prevention and control measures showed a 37% increase in the proportion of respondents who washed their hands before eating and after using the toilet (p < 0.001). About 52.8% of participants reported having heard about typhoid fever, however 25.9% had received health education. Only 34.6% and 38.6% of the respondents respectively knew how typhoid fever spreads and is prevented. Most respondents (98.2%) used pit latrines for disposal of feces. Long duration of stay in the camp, age over 35 years and being unemployed were statistically associated with poor hand washing practices. Conclusion: The findings of this study underline the need for bolstering up health education and hygiene promotion activities in Mahama and other refugee camp settings.Copyright © Marie-Rosette Nahimana et al.",2017,/,Pan African Medical Journal,28,"(Dassanayake) UNHCR, Kigali, Rwanda",54,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2017.28.54.12265,618939737,Nahimana 2017,NA,Search2018,0,1

Despite initial response by the local health department, the outbreak persisted. We conducted an investigation to identify the source and mode of transmission, and recommend evidence-led interventions to control and prevent cholera outbreaks in this area., METHODS: We defined a suspected case as the onset of acute watery diarrhoea from 1 October to 2 November 2015 in a resident of Kaiso Village. A confirmed case was a suspected case who had Vibrio cholerae isolated from stool. We found cases by record review and active community case finding. We performed descriptive epidemiologic analysis for hypothesis generation. In an unmatched case-control study, we compared exposure histories of 61 cases and 126 controls randomly selected among asymptomatic village residents. We also conducted an environmental assessment and obtained meteorological data from a weather station., RESULTS: We identified 122 suspected cases, of which six were culture-confirmed, 47 were confirmed positive with a rapid diagnostic test and two died. The two deceased cases had onset of the disease on 2 October and 10 October, respectively. Heavy rainfall occurred on 7-11 October; a point-source outbreak occurred on 12-15 October, followed by continuous community transmission for two weeks. Village residents usually collected drinking water from three lakeshore points - A, B and C: 9.8% (6/61) of case-persons and 31% (39/126) of control-persons were found to usually use point A, 21% (13/61) of case-persons and 37% (46/126) of control-persons were found to usually use point B (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 0.64-5.3), and 69% (42/61) of case-persons and 33% (41/126) of control-persons were found to usually use point C (OR=6.7; 95% CI: 2.5-17) for water collection. All case-persons (61/61) and 93% (117/126) of control-persons reportedly never treated/boiled drinking water (OR = , 95% CI Fisher: 1.0 - ). The village's piped water system had been vandalised and open defecation was common due to a lack of latrines. The lake water was found to be contiminated due to a gully channel that washed the faeces into the lake at point C., CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was likely caused by drinking lake water contaminated by faeces from a gully channel. We recommend treatment of drinking water, fixing the vandalised piped-water system and constructing latrines.",2017,/,Infectious diseases of poverty,6,1,146,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-017-0359-2,28992811,Oguttu 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design;,Search2018,0,0

#7208,Community health workers as frontline health responders in complex environments: Insights and lessons from Nepal and Pakistan,Creel L.; Pandit-Rajani T.; Devlin K.; Khana L.; Brady N.,"Background: Countries buffeted by the unexpected, such as natural disasters and political unrest, offer strategies for adapting community health systems to respond to local needs, and lessons for other countries to sustain and safeguard health gains. Using innovative approaches, Nepal and Pakistan adapted community health worker (CHW) programs to address challenges, increase program resilience, and improve services in complex environments. This paper discusses: Engaging CHWs in recovery efforts after Nepal's 2015 earthquake and strengthening routine immunization in Pakistan within a challenging political environment. Results: For nearly 30 years, Nepal's female community health volunteer (FCHV) program has prevented and treated key diseases; increased modern health service use; and reduced infant, child and maternal mortality. After the 2015 earthquake, Nepal mobilized 50,000 existing FCHVs as a critical component of recovery efforts to ensure uninterrupted community health services. In the nine districts, most affected by the earthquake, FCHVs were trained to deliver an integrated service package including chlorhexidine (CHX) for umbilical cord care to prevent neonatal sepsis; emergency nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene; and mental and psychosocial counselling. Pakistan's Sindh province has dangerously low child vaccination rates (29 percent) and a difficult political environment. The Health Department identified challenges for immunization delivery that impeded the mobility of vaccinators, including security issues, frequent vaccinator strikes, and lack of vehicles and fuel. In response, several innovative health systems strengthening approaches were identified: organizing and training community immunization champions including Lady Health Workers; using SMS technology to improve reporting, transparency and vaccinator accountability; and increasing community awareness of the immunization program. As a result, immunization registration doubled between 2015 and 2016 and the percentage of children and pregnant women receiving routine vaccines increased. Conclusion: Lessons from the successful and resilient programs in Nepal and Pakistan can be applied to contexts experiencing similar setbacks in health services, environmental disasters, and political upheaval.

Methods A randomized trial was conducted in a refugee population that had experienced repeated outbreaks of cholera and diarrhoea and where contamination of water in the home was found to be a significant cause of cholera. Four hundred Mozambican refugee households were systematically identified and followed over a 4-month period, one fourth of the households were randomly assigned to exclusively use the improved container for water collection. Findings Water flowing from the source wells had little or no microbial contamination although the water collectors quickly contaminated their water, primarily through contact with their hands. Analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (P = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket. Regression models examining diarrhoea among under 5-year-olds confirmed the protective effect of the bucket and found that visible faeces in the family latrine and the presence of animals were significantly associated with an increased diarrhoeal incidence in children. Conclusion Household contamination of drinking-water significantly contributed to diarrhoea in this population. Proper chlorination is a less expensive and more effective means of water quality protection in comparison with the improved bucket, but was unpopular and rarely utilized by the camp inhabitants.",2001,NA,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,79,4,280-280,106094121.

We described the outbreak and conducted a case test-negative study to identify risk factors for this genotype of HEV in an acute outbreak setting. Methods: Active case finding using a community based surveillance network identified suspected AJS cases. Pregnant or visibly ill AJS cases presenting at hospital were tested with Assure IgM HEV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and some with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in Amsterdam; confirmed cases were RDT-positive and controls were RDT-negative. All answered questions around: demographics, household makeup, area of residence, handwashing practices, water collection behaviour and clinical presentation. We calculated unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Between September and April 2017, 1443 AJS cases (1293 confirmed) were detected in the town(attack rate: 2%; estimated 65,000 population). PCR testing confirmed HEV genotype 1e. HEV RDTs were used for 250 AJS cases; 100 (40%) were confirmed. Risk factors for HEV infection, included: having at least two children under the age of 5 years (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.3), having another household member with jaundice (OR 2.4, 95%CI 0.90-6.3) and, with borderline significance, living in the neighbourhoods of Riad (OR 3.8, 95%CI 1.0-1.8) or Ridina (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.0-12.6). Cases were more likely to present with vomiting (OR 3.2, 9%CI 1.4-7.9) than controls; possibly due to selection bias. Cases were non-significantly less likely to report always washing hands before meals compared with controls (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.1-1.1). Discussion: Our study suggests household factors and area of residence (possibly linked to access to water and sanitation) play a role in HEV transmission; which could inform future outbreak responses. Ongoing sero-prevalence studies will elucidate more aspects of transmission dynamics of this virus with genotype 1e.Copyright © 2017 Spina et al.

We conducted a qualitative case study to explore barriers influencing the adoption, sustainablity and consistent use of sanitation facilities in rural Ethiopia., METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in the rural district of Becho, in central Ethiopia, from June to August 2016. A socio-ecological model and Integrated Behavioural Model (IBM) for a Water Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH) framework were employed to design the study and analyse data. A total of 10 in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with latrine adopters (n = 3), latrine non-adopters (n = 3), health extension workers (n = 3) and the district WASH coordinator (n = 1). Eight Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were undertaken with 75 participants, of which 31 were women. The FGDs and IDIs were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. The analysis was supported using Nvivo version 10 software., RESULTS: Barriers to sustained adoption and use of sanitation facilities were categorized into 1) individual level factors (e.g., past latrine experience, lack of demand and perceived high cost to improved latrines), 2) household level factors (e.g., unaffordability, lack of space and absence of a physically strong family member), 3) community level factors (e.g., lack of access to public latrines, lack of shared rules against open defecation, lack of financial access for the poor), and 4) societal level factors (e.g., lack of strong local leadership, flooding, soil conditions, lack of appropriate sanitation technology, lack of promotion and demand creation for improved latrines)., CONCLUSION: The use of the socio-ecological model and IBM-WASH framework helped to achieve a better understanding of multi-level and multi-dimensional barriers to sustained latrine adoption.

It is endemic in northern and central Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but it is reported only sporadically in neighboring Republic of the Congo (ROC). In October 2009, interethnic violence in northwestern DRC precipitated the movement of refugees across the Ubangi River into ROC. The influx of refugees into ROC heightened concerns about monkeypox in the area, because of the possibility that the virus could be imported, or that incidence could increase caused by food insecurity and over reliance on bush meat. As part of a broad-based campaign to improve health standards in refugee settlement areas, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) sponsored a program of intensive community education that includedmodules on monkeypox recognition and prevention. In the 6 months immediately following the outreach, 10 suspected cases of monkeypox were reported to health authorities. Laboratory testing confirmed monkeypox virus infection in two individuals, one of whom was part of a cluster of four suspected cases identified retrospectively. Anecdotes collected at the time of case reporting suggest that the outreach campaign contributed to detection of suspected cases of monkeypox.

A review on the iodine presence in drinking water reported in the literature was conducted, along with international standards and guidelines for iodine intake and iodine concentration in drinking water were also consulted. Chinese legislation was taken as the reference standard to evaluate the iodine concentration in water as adequate (10-150 mug/L) or not (high iodine >150 mug/L and iodine excess goitre >300 mug/L). Water sampling was conducted in 2015 and 2016 at the Saharawi camps (El Aiun, Awserd, Smara, Boujador and Dakhla) and at the institutional capital of Rabouni. The water supply in the camps is organized in three zones: El Aiun and Awserd where each 'wilaya' receives treated water 20 days and raw water another 20 days; Smara, Rabouni and Boujador receiving treated water continuously and Dakhla receiving raw water continuously. Results show that Smara, Rabouni and Boujador have access to drinking water with adequate iodine levels, as it occurs in Dakhla where raw water meets the Chinese standard, however in El Aiun and Awserd all population should have access to treated water given the current quality of the raw water supply. External supplies of water and animal milk could be also contributing to the high iodine intake. In conclusion, the contribution of drinking water as the main source of iodine to the urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and goitre prevalence among the Saharawi refugee population is not clear.

Results from sanitary inspections show that only half of the water supply installations at the hospitals are in adequate conditions and the rest present high risk of microbiological contamination. Water access in small medical community centres on the other hand present issues related to the non-availability of food-grade water tanks for the institutions (70%), the use of small 10 l containers as the main water supply (40%), poor maintenance (60% under antihygienic conditions and 30% with damaged covers), and insufficient chlorine levels that prevent microbiological contamination. Regarding water quality analyses, raw water supply in Smara, El Aiun and Awserd camps present high conductivity and high levels of fluoride, chloride, nitrate and sulphate, but dropping to normal levels within the drinking-water standards after water treatment via reverse osmosis plants. But for the case of El Aiun and Awserd, the reverse osmosis plant only provides treated water to the population each 20 days, so the population receives raw water directly and health risks should be evaluated. Finally, Dakhla water supply is the best in terms of physico-chemical parameters quality, currently providing safe drinking water after a chlorination stage. In summary, drinking water access has improved dramatically in the last years due to the efforts of local and international authorities but several issues remain to be solved: access to treated water for all the population, improved water quality controls (especially in Dakhla), expansion of distribution networks, and adequate storage systems and maintenance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,NA,Science of the Total Environment,550,NA,534-546,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.113,10070,Vivar 2016,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; Sarah Meteke (2018-01-30 07:24:24)(Select): comparing water access and chlorination levels, no intervention delivered;",NA,1,0

Rapid diagnostic tests are feasible alternatives for determining rotavirus outbreaks in refugee camps that have inadequate laboratory capacity.We evaluated the field performance of ImmunoCard STAT! Rotavirus (ICS-RV) in Dadaab Refugee Camp and at the Kenya-Somalia border. From May to December 2014, we prospectively enrolled children aged < 5 years hospitalized with acute diarrhea, defined as >= 3 episodes of loose stool in 24 hours for < 7 days. Stool samples were collected and tested by trained surveillance clerks using ICS-RV per manufacturer's instructions. The field performance characteristics of ICS-RV were evaluated against the gold standard test, PremierTM Rotaclone enzyme immunoassay. The operational characteristics were evaluated usingWorld Health Organization (WHO) ASSURED criteria to determine whether ICS-RV is appropriate as a point-of-care test by administering a standard questionnaire and observing surveillance clerks performing the test. We enrolled 213 patients with a median age of 10 months (range = 1-48); 58.2%weremale. A total of 71 (33.3%) and 60 (28.2%) patients tested positive for rotavirus infection by immunoassay and ICS-RV, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of ICS-RV compared with the immunoassay were 83.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 72.3-91.0), 99.3% (95% CI = 96.1-100), 98.3% (95% CI = 91.1-100), and 92.1% (95% CI = 86.6-95.5), respectively. The ICS-RV fulfilled theWHO ASSURED criteria for point-of-care testing. ICS-RV is a field-ready point-of-care test with good field performance and operational characteristics.

METHODS: Through the retrospective cohort study, we had surveyed all the residents who complained symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting since Nov. 20th,2007 from the five villages in the north of town Y, and collected hygiene information on the water supply system of the five villages, the environment information of three villages and hygiene information of some case-indexed families, and tested the etiological biomarker, including nucleoside acid of norovirus through Real-time PCR and nested PCR technologies. RESULTS: From Nov. 24th to Dec. 3th in 2007, 435 diarrhea or vomiting cases were found in the north of Y town, where tap water A was supplied for daily use. The attack rate was 12.93%. The diarrhea cases were distributed among all country groups who has used tap water A and the attack rate was ranged from 5.21% (20/384) to 21.23% (100/471). Drinking the tap water A was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (RR = 9.246, 95% CI: 6.25 -13.68). About 85.9% (262/ 305) of the cases were from Nov. 25th to 27th. An investigation of a country of S2 group showed that the incidence of different age groups was distributed as the following: 0 - year-old 20.0% (3/15); 10 - year-old 17.3% (9/52); 20 - year-old 15.2% (16/105); older than 60 year-old 23.3% (7/30). No statistical significance was identified between age and infection(chi2 = 1.15, P >0.05). Most of the patients were not serious and well prognostic, and no hospitalized or dead cases were reported. On site investigation and daily water quality monitoring showed that disinfection procedures were not strictly followed. The monitoring data also indicated the bacteriology index of tap water A was disqualified. The test of Salmonella, Shigella and Staphylococcus aureus were negative in two vomit and one stool samples from patients. Three specimens by Real-time PCR, and six by nested PCR were positive for norovirus among the three feces and three anal swabs samples. With the drinking water sterilization and health education, the epidemic had been controlled rapidly and effectively.

M.","Contex: Washing hands with soap prevents diarrhea, but children at the highest risk of death from diarrhea are younger than 1 year, too young to wash their own hands. Previous studies lacked sufficient power to assess the impact of household handwashing on diarrhea in infants. Objective: To evaluate the effect of promoting household handwashing with soap among children at the highest risk of death from diarrhea. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cluster randomized controlled trial of 36 low-income neighborhoods in urban squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan. Field workers visited participating households at least weekly from April 15, 2002, to April 5, 2003. Eligible households located in the study area had at least 2 children younger than 15 years, at least 1 of whom was younger than 5 years. Interventions: Weekly visits in 25 neighborhoods to promote handwashing with soap after defecation and before preparing food, eating, and feeding a child. Within intervention neighborhoods, 300 households (1523 children) received a regular supply of antibacterial soap and 300 households (1640 children) received plain soap. Eleven neighborhoods (306 households and 1528 children) comprised the control group. Main Outcome Measure: Incidence density of diarrhea among children, defined as the number of diarrheal episodes per 100 person-weeks of observation. Results: Children younger than 15 years living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhea (95% confidence interval [CI], -65% to -41%) compared with children living in control neighborhoods. Infants living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had 39% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI,-61% to -16%) vs infants living in control neighborhoods.

Methods For each of three refugee camps, we measured physical and chemical characteristics of water supplies at four points after distribution: (i) direc tly from tapstands; (ii) aft er collection; (iii) aft er transport to households; and (iv) aft er several hours of household storage. The following parameters were measured: free and total residual chlorine, temperature, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential. We documented water handling practices with spot checks and respondent self-reports. We analysed factors affecting residual chlorine concentrations using mathematical and linear regression models. Findings For initial free residual chlorine concentrations in the 0.5-1.5 mg/L range , a decay rate of ~5x10 -3 L/mg/min was found across all camps. Regression models showed that the decay of residual chlorine was related to initial chlorine levels, electrical conductivity and air temperature. Covering water storage containers, but not other water handling practices, improved the residual chlorine levels. Conclusion The concentrations of residual chlorine that we measured in water supplies in refugee camps in South Sudan were too low. We tentatively recommend that the free residual chlorine guideline be increased to 1.0 mg/L in all situations , irrespective of diarrhoeal disease outbreaks and the pH or turbidity of water supplies. According to our findings, this would ensure a free residual chlorine level of 0.2 mg/L for at least 10 hours aft er distribution.

However, little is known about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0.05% sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the log reduction in organisms after handwashing to the log reduction without handwashing. Rinse water was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1.94-3.01 log reduction in E. coli concentration without, and 2.18-3.34 with, soil load; and a 2.44-3.06 log reduction in Phi6 without, and 2.71-3.69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models. However, the magnitude of handwashing efficacy differences was small, suggesting protocols are similarly efficacious. Rinse water demonstrated a 0.28-4.77 log reduction in remaining E. coli without, and 0.21-4.49 with, soil load and a 1.26-2.02 log reduction in Phi6 without, and 1.30-2.20 with, soil load. Chlorine resulted in significantly less persistence of E. coli in both conditions and Phi6 without soil load in rinse water (p<0.001). Thus, chlorine-based methods may offer a benefit of reducing persistence in rinse water. We recommend responders use the most practical handwashing method to ensure hand hygiene in Ebola contexts, considering the potential benefit of chlorine-based methods in rinse water persistence.",2017,NA,PloS one,12,2,e0172734,NA,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172734,14835,Wolfe 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting;,Re-screen,1,0

War, poverty, inadequate sanitation, and large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) are major precursors to cholera outbreaks. In 2005, Southern Sudan ended its 22-year civil war with North Sudan; as a result, IDPs and refugees are returning to the south. During April--June 2007, investigators from the Southern Sudan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (SS-FELTP) and CDC investigated a cholera outbreak in the town of Juba, Southern Sudan. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which found that 3,157 persons were diagnosed with suspected cholera during January--June 2007, with 74 deaths resulting from the disease. An environmental investigation revealed suboptimal hygiene practices and a lack of water and sanitation infrastructure in Juba. A case-control study indicated that persons less likely to have cholera were more likely to have consumed hot meals containing meat during the outbreak. Contaminated food or water were not identified as possible sources of the cholera outbreak in Juba. However, this might be attributed to limitations of the study, including small sample size.

Uganda. The poor condition of drinking water vessels used in the camp was confirmed as a potential source for microbiological contamination both visually and by microbiological testing. Jerry cans were disinfected using high strength sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) generated using an experimental AquaChlor Solar unit. The study suggested that regular jerry can cleaning, using a high strength chlorine based disinfectant, offers an effective method of alleviating the adverse effects of contamination in water collection and storage vessels. Results indicated that the method is capable of significantly reducing thermo-tolerant coliform numbers to below 5 cfu/100 ml in most cases. Chlorine strength depletion after repetitive cleaning confirms the impact of process. The method does not substitute for good hygiene practices, which are essential for maintaining water quality in the household.

S.; Reis, M. G.; Ko, A. I.","Leptospirosis is an important health problem in slum settlements worldwide, which have environmental and social conditions for rat-borne transmission. We performed a propensity score-matched analysis of longitudinal data from a cohort of urban slum residents to delineate the role of poor environment and social status on Leptospira infection risk. A prospective study identified Leptospira infections, potential environmental transmission sources, socioeconomic factors, and risk behaviors among slum residents during four annual serosurveys. We calculated a propensity score to estimate the probability of an individual residing in proximity to environmental transmission sources, based on 13 socioeconomic variables, and a second score to estimate the probability of having a per capita daily household income below the median of $1.32, based on 16 environmental variables. We then created two matched cohorts based on these propensity scores in order to evaluate the isolated infection risk due to slum environment and social status, respectively, in Generalized Estimation Equation models. Among 1224 pairs of person-years of followup, matched according to propensity for environmental exposures, we found the 15-24 year (RR, 2.60, 95% CI, 1.29 - 5.23) and 25-34 year (RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.61 - 6.72) age groups, male gender (RR, 2.15; 95% CI,1.31 - 3.52), illiteracy (RR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.68 - 5.17), and household proximity to open waste sewers and flood risk areas (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.03 - 3.50) to be independent risk factors.

We found that poor environmental conditions associated with inadequate sewage and rainwater drainage significantly increase the risk of leptospirosis transmission, independent of economic status. Young adult male and illiterate participants were also at greater risk. Prevention of urban leptospirosis will therefore require improving infrastructure in slum communities. Furthermore, the specific exposures and risk behaviors of young males and individuals with low social status need to be identified in order to mount effective interventions.",2012,NA,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,87,5 SUPPL. 1,134,NA,NA,8112,Hagan 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting;,NA,0,0
#6420,"Monitoring drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene in non-household settings: Priorities for policy and practice","Cronk, R.; Slaymaker, T.; Bartram, J.","Inadequate drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) in non-household settings, such as schools, health care facilities, and workplaces impacts the health, education, welfare, and productivity of populations, particularly in low and middle-income countries. There is limited knowledge on the status of WaSH in such settings. To address this gap, we reviewed international standards, international and national actors, and monitoring initiatives; developed the first typology of non-household settings; and assessed the viability of monitoring. Based on setting characteristics, non-household settings include six types: schools, health care facilities, workplaces, temporary use settings, mass gatherings, and dislocated populations. To-date national governments and international actors have focused monitoring of non-household settings on schools and health care facilities with comparatively little attention given to other settings such as workplaces and markets. Nationally representative facility surveys and national management information systems are the primary monitoring mechanisms. Data suggest that WaSH coverage is generally poor and often lower than in corresponding household settings. Definitions, indicators, and data sources are underdeveloped and not always comparable between countries. While not all countries monitor non-household settings, examples are available from countries on most continents suggesting that systematic monitoring is achievable. Monitoring WaSH in schools and health care facilities is most viable. Monitoring WaSH in other non-household settings would be viable with: technical support from local and national actors in addition to international organizations such as WHO and UNICEF; national prioritization through policy and financing; and including WaSH indicators into monitoring initiatives to improve cost-effectiveness. International consultations on targets and indicators for global monitoring of WaSH post-2015 identified non-household settings as a priority. National and international monitoring systems will be important to better understand status, trends, to identify priorities and target resources accordingly, and to improve accountability for progressive improvements in WaSH in non-household settings. , Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.
